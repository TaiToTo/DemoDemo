### **Assessment & Evaluation**  
- **Memorization-Based Quizzes:** Focus on recalling definitions rather than application.  
- **Graded Notebook Checks:** Students are graded on whether they copied everything, not on their understanding.  
- **Minimal Feedback:** No personal reflections, no student opinions considered.

### **Why This Plan Is Worse**  
- **Lack of Engagement:** Activities focus on memorization rather than understanding.  
- **No Real-World Application:** Students don’t connect what they learn to real life.  
- **Minimal Critical Thinking:** No debates, discussions, or meaningful group work.  
- **Superficial Learning:** Students finish the week with definitions in their notebooks but no deeper understanding.
