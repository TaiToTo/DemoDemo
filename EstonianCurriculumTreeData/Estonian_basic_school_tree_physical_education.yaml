      label: As part of the subject field, physical education supports students in
        developing a health-conscious lifestyle, <br>creates a basis for students’
        independent exercising routine, facilitates interest in sports and dance events,
        <br>encourages students to follow competitions and events and to participate
        in them. Physical education <br>supports development of students’ physical/motor
        abilities, as well as moral, social and aesthetic <br>development and growth
        as wholesome persons. <br>In physical education lessons students are guided
        to monitor their physical fitness level and to improve it <br>through regular
        training and acquiring new (including independently acquired) knowledge and
        skills. <br>Exercising and practising sports in an environmentally friendly
        manner, being respectful towards fellow <br>students and valuing cooperation
        and the principles of fair play support students’ social and moral <br>development.
        <br>Physical education proceeds from the need to support the development of
        students to become healthy <br>individuals with good physical abilities. The
        knowledge, skills and experiences acquired in physical <br>education lessons
        encourage students’ diverse development and enable them to find a suitable,
        safe and <br>healthy exercising routine. <br>Basic school physical syllabus
        includes gymnastics, athletics (the learning outcomes and content of the 1st
        <br>stage of study including running, jumps and throws as the main forms of
        exercise), exercises and team <br>sports (basketball, volleyball and football
        – the school is obliged to teach two of these), dancing activities, <br>winter
        sports (skiing and skating – the school is obliged to teach one of these)
        and orienteering as primary <br>areas. Students complete a basic swimming
        course at the 1st or 2nd stage of study. Knowledge about sport <br>and exercising/practising
        sports is introduced through practical activities and/or guiding students
        towards <br>independent (extracurricular) learning. <br>When organising physical
        education, the schools have to take into account the interests of students,
        sports <br>or exercise traditions of the school and/or locality and existing
        sporting facilities. For this purpose, it is <br>envisaged that the learning
        outcomes specified in the subject syllabus of physical education are achieved
        <br>within 75-80% of the prescribed number of lessons.  <br>Schools are allowed
        to use 20-25% of the prescribed physical education lessons to teach sports
        and forms <br>of exercise not included in the syllabus (handball, hockey,
        baseball, badminton, different dance styles etc), <br>to reinforce the skills
        of the main fields of area included in the syllabus or to teach these in a
        more profound <br>manner. <br>Dancing activities performed in physical education
        lessons may be integrated with other sports and forms <br>of exercise. It
        is important to be familiar with popular Estonian folk dances and dance elements,
        which <br>connect students with the tradition of folk dance festivals. <br>The
        subject teacher selects the contents of education in consideration of achievability
        of the learning <br>outcomes, subject field competences and general competences
        for that study stage.

        Physical education supports the promoting health and sustainable <br>lifestyles.
        The understanding that it is necessary to protect and strengthen one’s health
        helps students <br>make reasonable choices in their health behaviour. Respect

        self-expression skills, and to read/understand informative and functional
        texts.  <br>Mathematics and natural sciences and technology competence. Analysis
        of sports-related technical <br>skills, explication of physical performance
        ability and the dynamics of sports results require that students <br>are able
        to use mathematical language, relations, methods, etc., and support development
        of mathematical <br>competence. They learn to analyse information associated
        with recreational sports and make evidence-<br>based decisions. They learn
        how to use technological tools.  <br>Entrepreneurial competence. Physical
        education promote the students’ ability to see problems and find <br>solutions,
        set objectives, generate ideas and find suitable means and methods for implement
        them. In <br>physical education studies students learn how to analyse their
        level of physical abilities and motor skills, <br>plan further activities
        and act in a directed manner towards improving their health and physical ability.
        <br>Cooperation with fellow students while exercising/practising sports develops
        coping skills and the courage <br>to take risks.

        and skills acquired in human <br>studies, biology, physics and geography.
        <br>Social subjects. Knowledge about national and international exercising
        and sports culture gained in <br>physical education lessons expands students’
        horizons. Adoption of a lifestyle valuing health and <br>awareness support

        efforts made to learn the activity/exercise <br>and diligence on the basis
        of written and/or practical tasks and activities, taking into account the

        are evaluated through verbal evaluation and numerical grades. The forms of

        tools are used and what are the criteria for evaluation. When <br>evaluating
        written tasks, the content is above all evaluated, but teachers also correct

        <br> <br>When evaluating students with special needs due to health problems,
        their participation in physical <br>education lessons is considered. Students’

        status of the <br>student – as an exercise subject to evaluation students
        shall perform simplified versions of test exercises or <br>the exercises prescribed
        by their attending physician. In case the health status of the student does

        the agreed rules). <br> <br>At the 1st stage of study, students’ activity
        in lessons is evaluated (activity, involvement, diligence, following <br>rules
        and hygiene and safety requirements etc). When evaluating the motor skills
        presented as learning <br>outcomes, both the achieved level as well as students’
