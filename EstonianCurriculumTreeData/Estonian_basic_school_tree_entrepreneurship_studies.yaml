      label: The study load of entrepreneurship studies is 35 hours and it is recommended
        to teach the subject in the <br>8th or 9th grade. <br>The subject is addressed
        in conjunction with daily life. The subject can be taught as a practical activity
        <br>through participation in the operation of the mini company.  Two thirds
        of the course load of the optional <br>subject is aimed at practical activities
        and the solution of tasks which develop creativity and critical thinking <br>skills.
        Practical work concerns a specific individual topic or material. Independent
        activities include <br>homework, class work and computer work.  <br>Priority
        is given to active teaching methods like discussions, case analyses, role
        plays, projects and <br>educational visits, visits to local companies, meetings
        with entrepreneurs and enterprising parents, and <br>volunteer work in the
        local community. <br>Entrepreneurship provides an overview of the functioning
        of companies and the importance of <br>entrepreneurship in the society. Entrepreneurship
        studies help better understand the interconnections <br>between human activity
        and the environment, and the scarcity of resources. Entrepreneurship studies
        <br>convey to the students the concept that both individuals and companies
        are responsible for ensuring the <br>sustainable development of the society.
        Entrepreneurship studies endeavour to make the students <br>understand that
        the decisions related to developing personal entrepreneurial skills and promoting
        <br>business operations must duly take into account the need to sustain the
        natural and living environment.  <br>The students receive information on the
        requirements related to various professions, learn the roles of <br>employee
        and entrepreneur (employer), learn to assess their skills, intentions, and
        development needs <br>and possibilities, prepare a curriculum vitae and assess
        the roles of employee and entrepreneur <br>(employer). <br>The students are
        taught to value entrepreneurship and the environment, and acquire problem
        solving and <br>research skills, management and teamwork skills, financial
        writing skills and digital competencies. The <br>teaching focuses strongly
        on developing the motivation to learn by relating the education to daily life
        and <br>local business.  <br>Entrepreneurship studies are closely linked to
        other subjects, relying on knowledge in mathematics, <br>geography and history,
        and supporting the acquisition of civics and citizenship education, personal,
        social <br>and health education, career education, and supporting career choice.
        In planning entrepreneurship <br>studies it is reasonable to plan and coordinate
        the provision of course content in consultation with the <br>teachers for
        civics and citizenship education, geography, personal, social and health education,
        <br>handicraft, home economics and technology education. For addressing discussion
        topics it is reasonable <br>to envisage cooperation with the teacher for language
        and literature. <br>To develop the students’ skills of using knowledge and
        technology, the teachers employ modern <br>technological means, incl. ICT
        facilities (web sites of companies, local and central government authorities,
        <br>legislation available on-line, the Company Registration Portal, interactive
        business games, value-based <br>games, etc.).   <br>To complete the course
        of entrepreneurship studies, the students can opt for the practical student
        <br>company program "Mini company".

      label: The learning outcomes of entrepreneurship studies are assessed on the
        basis of the assessment criteria <br>set out in the general part of the national
        curriculum for basic schools and other documents governing <br>such assessment.
        <br>The purpose of assessment is to obtain an overview of the learning outcomes
        attained and individual <br>student development and using the information
        obtained to plan more effective studies.  Assessment <br>includes the students’
        knowledge, their skills in implementing this knowledge, creativity in solving
        tasks, <br>and their acquisition of general competences, including learning
        skills. Assessment is based on oral <br>answers (presentations), written and
        practical work and independent activities, taking into account how <br>the
        knowledge and skills of the students comply with the learning outcomes stipulated
        in the curriculum.  <br>Formative assessment is prioritised as it develops
        the skills of reasoning, justification and establishing <br>connections, the
        students' independent work, participation in group work and discussions, due
        regard to <br>the formatting requirements of written work, and overall correctness.
        <br>Participation in group work and mini companies can be assessed during
        the learning process. The <br>learning outcomes are assessed using oral appraisal
        and numerical grades. The students must know <br>what is being assessed and
        when, what means are being used for assessment and what are the <br>assessment
        criteria. <br>The overall grade is derived from grades for tests, practical
        work and research papers, independent work, <br>and reports presented. <br>Depending
        on the selected teaching method, the school can choose between conducting
        a final <br>examination, preparing a learning portfolio, or drawing up a management
        report of the mini company <br>operated as part of the creative work completed
        in basic school.
