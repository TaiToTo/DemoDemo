      label: 'The optional course of economic and business studies is divided into
        two courses: <br>1) economic studies; <br>2) business studies. <br> <br>The
        goal of economic and business studies is to understand the events and processes
        taking place in <br>society and their relations at the individual, firm, national
        and international levels. Students are taught to <br>develop an enterprising,
        environmentally friendly and economical attitude to life and problem-solving
        and <br>research-performing skills. <br> <br>2 <br> <br>All economic systems
        function using various resources. Limited resources force countries, companies
        and <br>individuals to make very different choices and decisions. Economic
        and business studies improve <br>understanding of relations between people
        and the environment and ensure fairer decision-making. As <br>students learn
        to notice links between the environment, people and economic life, they also
        see the need <br>for sustainable living. <br>Students receive information
        about different professions, corresponding requirements and learning <br>opportunities,
        and also learn how to compile CVs and attend job interviews. Students learn
        to analyse <br>labour market supply and demand and see as well assess their
        own wishes and possibilities. They <br>understand how to make informed choice
        of profession, understanding not only the role of the employee, <br>but also
        that of the employer (entrepreneur). Students understand the value of employees
        as one of the <br>primary resources for employers as well as the necessity
        of equal treatment of all employees and <br>promotion of gender equality.
        <br> <br>In economic studies students acquire the skill of searching for and
        finding, using, analysing and assessing <br>various statistical materials
        and applying information technology. The material studied is presented in
        as <br>problem-based a manner as possible and should be connected with the
        students’ daily lives and current <br>events in the economy. <br> <br>Economic
        and business studies are closely integrated with other subjects, relying on
        the knowledge gained <br>in mathematics, geography and history and supporting
        civics and human studies. <br> <br>The teacher must complete a special training
        course to be able to supervise the establishment of a student <br>company.'

        development as active and independent learners and creative and critically
        thinking <br>individuals; <br>4) differentiated learning tasks are given and

      label: Assessment of learning outcomes in the elective subject of ‘Economic
        and Business Studies’ is based on <br>the principles of assessment specified
        in the general part of the national curriculum for upper secondary <br>schools
        and in other regulatory documents that govern assessment. The learning outcomes
        in the optional <br>course are checked and assessed with the aim of obtaining
        an overview of the learning outcomes attained <br>and individual student development
        and using the information obtained to plan more effective studies. <br>Assessed
        are the students’ knowledge, their skills in implementing this knowledge and
        their acquisition of <br>general competences, including learning skills on
        the basis of oral answers (presentations), written and/or <br>practical work
        and practical activities, taking into account how the knowledge and skills
        of the students <br>comply with the learning outcomes stipulated in the optional
        course syllabus. <br> <br>Checked and assessed are the students’ theoretical
        knowledge and the skills of working with economic <br>texts and statistical
        data, searching for and finding information and situation-solving. Assessed
        are the skills <br>of performing practical work, solving creative tasks and
        analysing management. This assessment is based <br>on creation of causal connections
        with relevant argumentation. Checked and assessed are the skill of <br>discussing,
        formulating argumentation and creating connections, as well as independent
        student work <br>(research and essays) and participation in group activities
        and discussions. <br> <br>The learning outcomes are assessed using oral appraisal
        and numerical grades. The students must know <br>what is being assessed and
        when, what means are being used for assessment and what the assessment <br>criteria
        are. <br> <br>The course grade is derived from grades for tests, practical
        work and research papers/independent <br>work/reports presented. <br>Assessment
        is based on independent work performance, creativity and proper formalisation.
        Practical work <br>is dedicated to a particular topic, material, etc. Independent
        work consists of home assignments, classroom <br>work and computer lesson
        work, with selective assessment. During the course the teacher can also assess
        <br>homework results, oral answers, task-solving, participation in group work,
        etc. <br> <br>The economic studies course is completed with a summarising
        assessment that covers all of the course <br>material. The business studies
        course ends, depending on the selected teaching method, with a final test
        or <br>presentation and defence of the management report or business plan
        of the students’ company.
