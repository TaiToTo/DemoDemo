      label: 'The general goal of teaching informatics is to ensure that basic school
        graduates are able to use the ICT to <br>shape their current working and learning
        environments. Hence, school informatics focuses primarily on the <br>competences
        needed in the school context and less on compliance with the future job requirements.
        <br>Informatics at the basic school level does not have to be taught on the
        basis of the structure and content of <br>the academic discipline of computer
        science that is the indirect foundation of the school subject of <br>informatics.
        The teacher should instead proceed first and foremost in accordance with the
        daily needs of <br>students as computer and Internet users. At the same time
        it is recommended to offer to students attending <br>science-biased schools
        the additional course entitled “Introduction to computer science”. <br> <br>The
        following are the principles of teaching informatics at the basic school level:
        <br>1) relevance: examples, tasks, etc. are derived from daily life and are
        familiar to the students (school, <br>home, hobbies and mass media); <br>2)
        active learning and creativity: preference is given to learning methods that
        stimulate student <br>activeness and creativity; <br>3) innovation: novel
        technology and solutions are preferred as encouraged by the cross-curriculum
        <br>dimension “Technology and innovation”; <br>4) collaborative learning:
        both during lessons of informatics and for home assignments preference is
        <br>given to methods of collaborative learning; <br>5) knowledge creation:
        new knowledge is co-constructed by learners through meaningful collaborative
        <br>activities, not acquired by memorising outdated information; <br>2 <br>
        <br>6) freeware and open content: wherever possible, free software and content
        with flexible licenses are <br>preferred over proprietary software and copyrighted
        content; <br>7) safety: the school promotes safe ways of network usage and
        ensures that the online systems and <br>services used by students are secure
        ; <br>8) integration with other subjects: learning tasks, such as abstracts
        and presentations, use topics from <br>other subjects; and <br>9) independence
        from software vendors: the study process cannot be based on the use of a <br>platform/solution
        provided by just one software vendor; it is the duty of the school to introduce
        <br>alternatives. <br> <br>The subject of informatics can be easily integrated
        with all other subjects because ICT is a natural part of <br>the modern learning
        environment. Such integration is bidirectional: on the one hand, learning
        tasks for <br>informatics are compiled using topics from other subjects to
        foster meaningful learning and, on the other <br>hand, ICT competences are
        shaped in other subjects through the work on written texts and presentations,
        <br>data collection and analysis. Special attention should be given to opportunities
        for strong interrelation <br>between the updated civics and informatics syllabuses,
        addressing the topics of the e-government, e-<br>inclusion and virtual communities.
        The syllabus of informatics creates the conditions for the successful <br>integration
        of the cross-curriculum dimension “Technology and innovation” into other subjects.
        <br> <br>The approach to the subject of informatics is conventionally concentric
        as the students revisit previously <br>acquired knowledge and skills in greater
        depth at every subsequent stage of schooling. The main stress is <br>on practical
        computer use when studying different subjects. <br>During the 1st stage of
        study, ICT-related topics are studied as integrated into other subjects and
        there is no <br>need for a separate informatics course. At the end of the
        2nd stage of study it is recommended to teach the <br>first course from this
        syllabus (“Working with Computer”) and during the 3rd stage of study  the
        second <br>course, entitled “Information Society Technologies”.'

        minimalism in design; <br>9) compile, on the basis of received data, a data
        sheet, frequency tables and charts of a suitable type <br>(column, pie or

        at the 2nd stage of study is predominantly delivered in the form of exploratory
        and <br>active learning. The students are allowed to learn new work methods
        through self-activity. Lectures should <br>be avoided, but a systematic approach
        to the skills studied must be ensured, primarily via well-planned <br>study
        tasks with feedback. <br>To ensure understanding of the course content, self-reflection
        on the acquired knowledge must be <br>supported along with oral reports. The
        students must be able to explain their work methods and decisions <br>using
        proper terminology in their native language. <br>In addition to predominantly
        individual tasks, student group work must be facilitated (including an online
        <br>environment). It is important to adhere to the principle of methodological
        diversity, switching between <br>individual and group work and between exploratory
        and presentational learning strategies in lessons. <br>The topics for abstracts
        and presentations are usually taken from other subjects, thus improving subject
        <br>integration.'
