        direct the students to <br>understand and value lifelong learning as a lifestyle
        and to consider career planning as a continuous <br>process of making decisions.
        Learning activities enable direct contact with the working world, e.g. <br>visits
        to companies, students being introduced to occupations professions and further
        learning <br>possibilities related to the subject field. The learning activities
        enable the students to deepen their <br>knowledge of the associations between
        education and the working world. The student’s ability to <br>learn independently
        and their responsibility and skills of independently finding and analysing
        <br>information about educational options based on their development needs
        and to prepare a career <br>plan is developed. Different learning activities,
        including the independent work of the students, <br>enable the student to
        associate their interests and capabilities with their subject knowledge and
        skills <br>and to understand that hobbies and interests keep life and career
        in balance. A general positive <br>5 <br> <br>attitude towards natural sciences
        and learning them, interest in continuing to study natural sciences <br>is
        achieved by taking into consideration the interests and individuality of the
        student and by applying <br>problem and investigation based studies. Learning
        activities enable the student to broaden their <br>understanding of the specialities
        in the field of natural sciences and the modern work of scientist.  <br> <br>Environment
        and sustainable development. At the upper secondary school level, the students
        <br>develop their skills of making justified decisions and evaluation, taking
        into consideration the <br>potential and limitations of modern scientific
        and technological developments, as well as legislative <br>documents. This
        supports their readiness to become involved at the personal, social and global
        <br>levels in environmental protection issues as citizens with critical minds,
        and to apply sustainable and <br>economic practices in their private and business
        lives. <br> <br>Civil initiative and entrepreneurship. Natural sciences value
        cooperation based on democracy and <br>free will, develop cooperation skills
        and promote initiative. Awareness of civil rights and obligations is <br>related
        to all matters of human and environmental development both on the local and
        global levels.  <br> <br>Cultural identity.  Appreciation of the living environment
        of Estonia, the cultural heritage, the <br>naturalists related to Estonia
        and their contribution to the development of science. Developing <br>tolerance

        label: The biology taught in upper secondary school is based on developing
          competencies in the use of <br>knowledge, skills, attitudes and values acquired
          from basic school; it is linked to chemistry, <br>geography, physics, mathematics
          and other subjects taught in upper secondary school. The use of <br>knowledge,
          skills, attitudes and values gained from biology lessons at this level,
          when integrated with <br>the use made of knowledge, skills,  attitudes and
          values gained from other subjects, form the basis <br>for internally motivated
          lifelong learning. <br> <br>Through problem-solving, the biology taught
          in upper secondary schools gives students a <br>comprehensive overview of
          the diversity of life, the structure and functioning of organisms, heredity,
          <br>evolution and ecology, as well as the basics of environmental protection
          and applied biology. <br>Students gain knowledge of  laws, theories and
          trends in biology, as well as of their applications and <br>professions
          connected to biology, thus helping them make career decisions. <br>The knowledge
          and skills of biology are learned predominantly through exploratory tasks
          based on <br>scientific methods. Through these tasks the students learn
          the skills of problem-setting, framing <br>hypotheses, planning experiments
          and observations, carrying them out, and analysing and <br>8 <br> <br>interpreting
          the results. Another important aspect is oral and written presentations
          of research <br>results, involving appropriate verbal and visual forms of
          presentation. At the same time, skills in <br>solving the biological problems
          occurring in everyday life and making competent socio-scientific <br>decisions
          are developed, improving the students’ ability to survive in natural and
          social <br>environments. <br> <br>The learning process is problem-based
          and student-centred, guided by the personality and age traits of <br>the
          students as individuals, and their different talents. TStudies are based
          on active learning principles <br>with a focus on exploratory discourse
          based on scientific methods, and solving biological problems <br>integrating
          the natural, technological and social environments, through which the students
          develop their <br>higher mental processes. <br> <br>Technological instruments
          and ICT are used during all stages of the learning process. At the same
          <br>time, skills in using various (including electronic) sources of information
          and evaluating the <br>truthfulness of the information obtained from these
          sources are also developed. In upper secondary <br>school biology, one focal
          point is developing the intrinsic learning motivation of the students, and
          to <br>achieve this aim, various active learning methods – problem learning
          and exploratory learning, <br>project learning, role plays, discussions,
          brainstorming, compiling definition cards, outdoor learning, <br>educational
          visits et al. – are used. <br> <br>Through all of this, students acquire
          biological  knowledge and skills, thus enabling them to <br>understand,
          explain and forecast various natural phenomena and processes. At the same
          time, a <br>positive attitude towards biology as a science and as a cultural
          phenomenon is developed, also <br>taking into consideration the scientific,
          economic, social, political, ethical and moral aspects of socio-<br>scientific
          decision making.

        id: 41
        label: Geography is an integrated subject considered to be both a science
          and a social science subject. The <br>geography in upper secondary school
          is based on the knowledge, skills and attitudes acquired during <br>basic
          education; it is intertwined with the curricula of physics, chemistry, biology,
          mathematics, history, <br>civic studies and economics. The knowledge, skills
          and attitudes learned in geography lessons support <br>motivated lifelong
          learning. <br> <br>Studying geography develops the students’ concept of
          the Earth as an integrated whole and their <br>understanding of different
          processes in nature and society, as well as the spatial distribution and
          <br>interdependence of these processes. The focus is on learning the interaction
          between the <br>environment and human activities and on supporting sustainable
          behaviour. The environment is <br>understood in its broadest sense, encompassing
          the natural, economic, social and cultural <br>environments.  <br> <br>Geography
          plays an important role in shaping the values and attitudes of the students.
          Integrated <br>discussion of natural, population and cultural geography
          forms the basis for understanding cultures <br>and a tolerant attitude towards
          the cultures and traditions of other countries and peoples. <br>Understanding
          the integrated evolution of nature and society forms the basis for understanding
          modern <br>problems of development and for planning future developments.
          In order to cope in a globalising world, <br>people must be better informed
          about its different regions and their economies, cultures and traditions.
          <br>Studying geography helps students define themselves as active citizens
          of Estonia, Europe and the <br>world. <br> <br>In studying geography, the
          students acquire skills in reading maps and using the numerous <br>possibilities
          of information technology – skills that are becoming more and more important
          in our <br>mobile society. Another important feature of geography is Geographical
          Information Systems (GIS), <br>which are becoming more and more important
          in many professions and fields of human activity. <br>18 <br> <br> <br>The
          material of the subject is presented as problem-based wherever possible,
          with examples given <br>from everyday life. Studies are based on the individuality
          of the students and the multi-faceted <br>development of their abilities.
          A lot of attention is paid to developing motivation in the students for
          <br>learning. To achieve this aim, various active learning methods – problem
          learning and exploratory <br>learning, project learning, discussions, brainstorming,
          role plays, educational visits, etc. – are <br>applied. Modern technological
          equipment and ICT are used. <br> <br>Exploratory learning gives the students
          skills in proposing scientific problems, framing hypotheses, <br>planning
          research work, collecting data, and processing, interpreting and presenting
          the results. <br>Another important aspect is developing the ability to use
          sources of information, including the <br>Internet, and the ability to assess
          these sources critically.

        label: Chemistry plays an important role in enhancing students’ scientific
          and technological literacy. The <br>chemistry taught in upper secondary
          school is based on the use of chemical  knowledge, skills, <br>attitudes
          and values acquired in basic school; it is linked to physics, biology, mathematics
          and other <br>subjects taught in upper secondary school, while at the same
          time supporting the learning and <br>teaching of other subjects. By studying
          chemistry, students develop several important competencies <br>and achieve
          an enhanced positive attitude towards chemistry and other sciences, while
          also <br>understanding the importance of the sciences in the economic, technological
          and cultural <br>26 <br> <br>development of human societies. The students
          develop a responsible attitude towards their <br>immediate environment and
          learn to value healthy and sustainable lifestyles. The knowledge, skills
          <br>and attitudes gained from chemistry and other science lessons form the
          basis for internally motivated <br>lifelong learning. The students develop
          scientific and technological literacy and an integrated <br>scientific worldview
          corresponding to the upper secondary level and gain an overview of the main
          <br>laws and theories associated with chemical processes, future trends
          in chemistry and professions <br>linked to chemistry, thus helping them
          make career decisions. <br> <br>Knowledge of chemistry is predominantly
          learned through exploratory tasks, where students learn <br>skills of problem-setting,
          framing hypotheses, planning experiments and the determination of <br>observations,
          carrying out the experimentation, analysing and interpreting the results.
          In solving <br>chemical problems at the upper secondary level, the main
          focus is on understanding the problem <br>discussed, analysing the results
          and arriving at conclusions, rather than learning by heart and routine <br>training
          of mathematical algorithms of standard problems. Another important aspect
          is to develop <br>skills in identifying various sources of information,
          including the Internet, and analysing and critically <br>assessing the information
          obtained from these sources, as well as oral and written presentations of
          <br>investigatory outcomes, involving appropriate forms of presentation.
          Technological equipment and <br>ICT are used in all stages of the learning
          process. <br> <br>In studying chemistry, the focus is on building links
          between this subject and other sciences, but also <br>on processes taking
          place in nature (including humans) and relationships between humans and
          <br>natural as well as artificial materials. Applying the knowledge and
          skills learned in solving everyday <br>problems, making competent and ethical
          decisions and estimating the possible consequences of <br>these decisions
          are all skills that are taught. <br> <br>The curriculum is presented as
          problem-based and student-centred and linked to everyday life. The <br>learning
          process is based on the individual traits of the students and their different
          talents, and attention is <br>paid to developing intrinsic of the students.
          To achieve this, various types of active learning approaches – <br>problem
          learning and exploratory learning, project learning, discussions, brainstorming,
          educational visits <br>et al. – are used. Curricular activities using active
          learning principles help the students to develop their <br>higher mental
          processes. <br> <br>The chemistry taught in upper secondary school extends
          the knowledge, skills and expertise <br>acquired in basic school. Compared
          with the basic school curriculum, the chemistry at upper <br>secondary school
          considers the phenomena and processes of chemistry more profoundly, exactly
          <br>and systematically, paying more attention to building connections. Inductive
          learning is <br>complemented with deductive learning. Students learn to
          draw conclusions based on knowledge <br>gained, find associations between
          different phenomena and apply their learning in new situations. <br>The
          educational activities are directed towards fostering the intellect, skills
          and creativity of the <br>students. Other important aspects are to develop
          the skill of working independently and the ability to <br>use different
          sources of information and to distinguish between what is significant and
          what is <br>insignificant. In studying chemistry, as with other science
          subjects, the development of the students’ <br>personality – independence,
          intellect and teamwork skills as well as responsibility and working habits
          <br>– are important.

        label: Physics is among natural sciences, while being closely intertwined
          with mathematics. Physics forms <br>the basis for understanding machines
          and technology and helps to value professions linked to <br>technology.
          In the curriculum of physics, the importance of vertical and horizontal
          integration of <br>natural science subjects is taken into account. In case
          of vertical integration, the universal topics are <br>scientific methods,
          hierarchic structure of nature, interaction, motion (change and transformation),
          <br>energy, scientific and technological literacy, technology, living environment
          and society. Vertical <br>integration is supported by the horizontal integration
          of the subjects. <br>The aim of upper secondary school physics is to give
          necessary knowledge in physics to future <br>citizens, to develop their
          attitudes directed at preserving the environment and the society and at
          <br>sustainable development. At upper secondary school, physical phenomena
          are discussed <br>systematically and holistically, developing a complete
          understanding of nature and putting emphasis <br>on the essential relations
          between the parts of the complete image. Compared with the basic school
          <br>curriculum, the upper secondary school curriculum more profoundly discusses
          various interactions <br>and the types of motion caused by them and looks
          for associations between different forms of <br>motion. <br>For developing
          the critical and systematic thinking of the students, problems and issues
          from various <br>fields and subjects of life are solved by physics, experiments
          are planned and carried out using <br>natural science methods. When solving
          quantitative tasks, it is not necessary to know the formulae <br>by heart,
          but skills are developed to understand the physical content of the formulae
          and implement <br>formulae in the correct context. The studies develop values,
          which determine the attitude of the <br>students towards physics as a cultural
          phenomenon, open the role of physics in machines, <br>technology and the
          environment as well as the sustainable development of the society. The physics
          <br>in upper secondary school together with other subjects is aimed at developing
          a modern and <br>complete worldview in the students, also a sustainable
          attitude towards the environment, whole also <br>developing their skills
          of analysis. <br>The general skills developed in upper secondary school
          physics lessons differ from those gained in <br>basic school in terms of
          more extensive use of deductive discussions and considerations of the <br>validity
          of generalisations. Upper secondary school physics is more specific, but
          with knowledge s <br>closely tied to knowledge acquired from other subjects
          and during basic school. <br>The physics curriculum in upper secondary school
          consists of five compulsory courses and two <br>optional subjects. The first
          course “Introduction to Physics. Kinematics of Translational Motion” <br>explains
          what physics is, what it can do and how it differs from and is associated
          with other natural <br>sciences. The implementation of natural science methods
          is deeper, widening knowledge and skills <br>regarding measuring as the
          basis of experimental sciences. <br>The second course “Mechanics” unlocks
          the central role of mechanical models in describing and <br>explaining natural
          phenomena. <br>As all modern physics is dominated by the need to take into
          consideration the special characteristics <br>of substances and fields,
          the third course “Electromagnetism” uses the example of electromagnetic
          <br>fields to discuss the main methods of describing fields, but also the
          most important electrical and <br>optical phenomena. <br>The fourth course
          “Energy” takes a look at the environment from the viewpoint of energy. Direct
          <br>current, alternating current and thermal phenomena are discussed, as
          well as mutual <br>transformations between mechanical energy, thermal energy,
          luminous energy and nuclear energy. <br>33 <br> <br>The fifth course “Physics
          of the Micro and Mega Worlds” examines the laws and processes of <br>physics
          in dimensions, which are more than a million times different from the measurements
          <br>characterising humans (1 m). <br>The order of teaching the last two
          compulsory courses is the teacher’s decisions. The list of practical <br>work
          provides general topics, on the basis of which the teacher will plan activities
          based on either <br>practical work. ICS, demonstrative or participatory
          experiments. <br>The primary aim of the two optional courses described in
          the curriculum is to offer possibilities to <br>broaden and deepen discussions
          of the latter two compulsory courses. Both of these courses consist <br>of
          15 modules, each consisting of 2-6 lessons. The teacher chooses up to 8
          modules. The course <br>“Physics and Machines” broadens and deepens students’
          knowledge of the topics discussed in the <br>compulsory course “Energy“,
          focusing on the technological applications of physics. The optional <br>course
          “A Different Kind of Physics“ expands the topics discussed in the compulsory
          course “The <br>Physics of the Micro and Mega Worlds“.

      label: 'Description of the course <br> <br>‘Applied Biology’ plays an important
        role in shaping the students’ scientific and technology literacy. <br>The
        course is based on the knowledge, skills and attitudes acquired during the
        compulsory courses <br>of biology, but it is also linked to chemistry, geography,
        physics, mathematics and other subjects <br>taught in upper secondary level.
        At the same time, the knowledge and skills concerning the <br>phenomena, theories
        and future trends of biology gained from other upper secondary school courses
        <br>are revised so that the applications and professions associated with them
        become more familiar, <br>thus helping the students in their career choices.  <br>
        <br>The learning process is problem-based and student-centred, guided by the
        personality and age traits of <br>the students as individuals and their different
        talents. The studies follow the principles of active learning <br>with a focus
        on exploratory discourse based on scientific methods and solving scientific
        problems <br>integrating the natural, technological and social environments,
        through which the students develop their <br>higher mental processes. <br>
        <br>The knowledge and skills of biology are learned predominantly by exploratory
        tasks based on <br>scientific methods. Through these tasks the students learn
        the skills of problem-setting, framing <br>hypotheses, planning experiments
        and observations, carrying them out and analysing and <br>interpreting the
        results. Another important aspect is oral and written presentations of investigatory
        <br>results, involving appropriate verbal and visual forms of presentation.
        At the same time, the skills of <br>solving the scientific problems derived
        from everyday life and making competent socio-scientific <br>decisions are
        developed, improving the students’ ability to survive in the natural and social
        <br>environments. <br> <br>In the learning process, one focal point is developing
        the internal learning motivation of the students. <br>To achieve this aim,
        various active learning methods – including problem learning and exploratory
        <br>learning, project learning, roleplay, discussions, brainstorming, compiling
        definition cards, outdoor <br>learning and educational visits – are used.
        <br> <br>Technological equipment and ICT are used during all stages of the
        learning process. During the <br>learning process, the students acquire the
        ability to use various sources of information, including <br>electronic sources,
        and develop the ability to assess the validity of the information obtained
        from <br>these sources. All of this develops the students’ skills and knowledge
        of biology, thus enabling them <br>to understand, explain and forecast various
        natural phenomena. At the same time, a positive attitude <br>is produced towards
        biology as a science and a cultural phenomenon that considers scientific,
        <br>economic, social, legislative, ethical and moral aspects in solving everyday
        socio-scientific issues. <br> <br>44 <br> <br>Learning and educational objectives
        <br> <br>This optional course is designed for students to: <br>1) develop
        their scientific and technological literacy, as well as creativity and systematic
        way of <br>thinking; <br>2) be interested in biology and other sciences, understand
        the importance of sciences in <br>everyday life and be motivated for lifelong

        putting this together, the main principle is to cover all of the <br>topics
        on the basis of examples from different regions of the world. A chosen topic
        is presented in a <br>problem-based way wherever possible, taking a specific
        region, area, country or city as an example. <br>The examples are chosen according
        to their importance in the local, regional or global context. The <br>analysis

        is based on the knowledge, skills and attitudes acquired from the <br>compulsory
        chemistry courses of upper secondary level, and this course is also integrated
        with the <br>curricula of other science subjects, while also offering support
        in the learning and teaching of other <br>subjects. <br> <br>This course extends
        the knowledge, skills and expertise gained from compulsory chemistry courses
        <br>at upper secondary level, enabling the students to better understand the
        general laws of chemical <br>processes and their various mechanisms, and giving
        them a better understanding of quantitative <br>relations in chemical processes.
        The students gain a systematic overview of the physical foundations <br>of
        chemical processes and the laws governing these processes, as well as of future
        trends in <br>chemistry and professions linked to chemistry, thus helping
        them in their career choices. <br> <br>The aim is to broaden the students’
        chemical and general scientific worldview and build a strong <br>basis so
        that they can continue their education in fields connected to the sciences.
        At the same time, <br>skills in solving everyday scientific problems and making
        competent and ethical socio-scientific <br>decisions are learned, thus improving
        the students’ ability to cope in the natural and social <br>environment. <br>Through
        this, the students develop important competences and gain a positive attitude
        towards <br>chemistry and other sciences, while also understanding the importance
        of sciences in the economic, <br>technological and cultural development of
        human societies. The students develop a responsible <br>attitude towards their
        immediate environment and learn to assess the potential consequences of <br>their
        actions. Such knowledge, skills and attitudes form the basis for internally
        motivated lifelong <br>learning. <br> <br>The material of this curriculum
        is presented as problem-based, student-centred and linked to <br>everyday
        life. The learning process is based on the personal traits and multi-faceted
        development of <br>the students, while paying attention to developing internal
        learning motivation in the students. To <br>achieve this, various types of
        active learning – problem, exploratory and project learning, <br>discussions,
        etc. – are used. Curricular activities following the principles of active
        learning help the <br>students to develop their higher mental processes. Another
        important aspect is developing the <br>students’ ability to work independently,
        use different sources of information, distinguish between the <br>significant
        and the insignificant and use their knowledge in problem-solving. <br>Teaching
        the optional course is supported by the wide range of active learning methods:
        role play, <br>discussions, debates, project learning, compiling learning
        folders and research papers, practical <br>work (e.g. studying and analysing

        of the course <br> <br>This optional course of chemistry is based on the knowledge,
        skills and attitudes gained from the <br>compulsory chemistry courses at the
        upper secondary level and is integrated with the curricula of <br>other science
        subjects, while also supporting the learning and teaching of other subjects.
        <br> <br>This course extends the knowledge, skills and expertise learned from
        the compulsory chemistry <br>courses at the upper secondary level, thus enabling
        the students to better understand the general <br>laws of chemical processes
        and broadening their understanding of the chemical compounds in our <br>bodies
        and the chemical processes taking place in organisms. Students gain a systematic
        overview <br>of the main chemical elements and properties of these compounds
        and about future trends in and <br>professions linked to chemistry, thus helping
        them in making career decisions. <br> <br>52 <br> <br>The aim is to broaden
        the chemical and general scientific worldview of the students and give them
        a <br>strong basis to continue their education in fields linked to the sciences.
        At the same time, skills in <br>solving everyday problems and making competent
        and ethical decisions are learned, thus improving <br>the students’ ability
        to cope in natural and social environments. <br> <br>Through this, the students
        develop important competences and achieve a positive attitude towards <br>chemistry
        and other sciences, while also understanding the importance of sciences in
        the economic, <br>technological and cultural development of human societies.
        Students develop a responsible attitude <br>towards their immediate environment
        and learn to evaluate the potential consequences of their actions. <br>Such
        knowledge, skills and attitudes form the basis for internally motivated lifelong
        learning. <br> <br>The material of this curriculum is presented as problem-based,
        student-centred and linked to <br>everyday life. The learning process is based
        on the personal traits and multi-faceted development of <br>the students,
        while paying attention to developing internal learning motivation in the students.
        To <br>achieve this, various types of active learning – problem, exploratory
        and project learning, <br>discussions, etc. – are used. Curricular activities
        following the principles of active learning help the <br>students to develop
        their higher mental processes. Another important aspect is developing the
        <br>students’ ability to work independently, use different sources of information,
        distinguish between the <br>significant and the insignificant and use their
        knowledge in problem-solving. <br> <br>Learning and educational objectives

      label: 'Description of the course <br> <br>This course is based on solving problems
        of physics and technology that the students are capable of <br>solving themselves.
        The students are directed towards making reasoned and competent socio-<br>scientific
        decisions concerning specific issues, while considering the scientific, technological,
        <br>economic, environmental social, moral and ethical dimensions. At the same
        time, a balance is struck <br>between applying, in a new context, earlier
        knowledge gained primarily from physics lessons, but <br>also from other compulsory
        science subjects, and learning new technological knowledge and skills <br>based
        on the physical core of modern high-tech products. <br> <br>56 <br> <br>The
        structure of this course consists of three levels: (a) introducing the scientific
        problem (such as <br>the need for corrective nanoscopic manipulations for
        scanning tunnelling microscopy); (b) gaining <br>new knowledge through scientific
        problem solving, often based on an investigatory approach <br>(piezoelectric
        materials and their properties); and (c) reaching a suitable socio-scientific
        decision <br>(piezoelectric detectors and their actuators). Practical work
        is used extensively, mainly to determine <br>the properties of the materials
        or technical equipment studied, but practical work could also be a <br>source
        of gaining new knowledge in physics. <br> <br>The educational learning content
        of this course lists 15 modules, each covering 3 to 6 lessons. Of <br>these,
        the teacher, in cooperation with the students, can choose 8 modules, taking
        into consideration <br>the needs or interests of the students. The modules
        in the learning content list are presented in the <br>preferred order of taking
        them. The learning content of these modules is constantly updated to reflect
        <br>the developments taking place in science and technology, and to correspond
        to the needs of the <br>knowledge-based society. <br> <br>If the same topics
        are discussed in compulsory courses and in optional courses, the qualitative
        <br>discussion offered by the compulsory course is complemented by quantitative
        discussion in the <br>optional course. <br> <br>Learning and educational objectives
        <br> <br>This optional course is designed for students to: <br>1) gain knowledge,
        skills, attitudes and values that will be useful in their future profession,
        <br>most likely linked to technical or technological fields; <br>2) be able
        to identify physical and technical problems in their everyday life; <br>3)  find
        reliable information to solve the problems becoming evident in the technological
        <br>environment surrounding us; <br>4) apply scientific methods, including
        the exploratory approach in solving these problems; <br>5)  make well-founded
        socio-scientificl decisions in less complicated situations; <br>6) examine
        technological problems with a creative and critical way of thinking; <br>7)
        use oral and written technical communication; <br>8) gain attitudes valuing
        scientific and technological knowledge and readiness for lifelong <br>learning;
        and <br>9) evaluate technological risks and predict the effects new technological
        solutions could have <br>on the environment. <br> <br> <br>Learning outcomes
        <br> <br>Learning outcomes describe the level of achievements for students.
        <br>By the end of the course, students are expected to have the capacity to:
        <br>1) identify physical and technological problems in their everyday life
        and propose solutions to <br>these problems; <br>2) analyse the given examples
        of problems concerning physics and technology and make <br>reasoned decisions
        about them; <br>3) combine their new technological knowledge with earlier,
        basic scientific knowledge to form <br>an integrated whole; <br>4) describe
        present solutions to physical or technological problems and analyse the strong
        and <br>weak aspects of these solutions; <br>57 <br> <br>5) analyse the environmental
        or personal dangers accompanying physical or technological <br>solutions and
        ways of minimising these risks; <br>6) explain the nature of physical sciences
        and the corresponding technology, their role in <br>society and their relationship
        with other science subjects taught at school; and <br>7) become intrinsically
        motivated for lifelong improvement of their knowledge of physics and <br>technology.

        of the physics of the micro world and/or cosmology that <br>the students are
        capable of solving themselves. After taking this course, the students are
        directed <br>towards making reasoned and competent socio-scientific decisions
        concerning these specific issues, <br>while considering the scientific, technological,
        economic, social, moral and ethical dimensions. At the <br>same time, a balance
        is struck between applying, in a new context, earlier knowledge gained <br>primarily
        from physics lessons, but also from other compulsory science subjects, and
        learning new <br>skills based on the physical essence of the concepts discussed.
        <br> <br>The educational learning content of this course lists 15 modules,
        each covering 3 to 6 lessons. Of <br>these, the teacher, in cooperation with
        students, can choose 8 modules, taking into consideration the <br>needs and
        interests of the students. The modules in the learning content list are presented
        in the <br>preferred order of taking them. The learning content of these modules
        is constantly updated to reflect <br>new discoveries in micro physics and
        cosmology, and to correspond to the needs of the knowledge-<br>based society.
        This course may be organised as a course discussing either the physics of
        the micro <br>world or cosmology only (choosing the corresponding modules)
        if the students seek this. <br>If the same topics are discussed in the compulsory
        course and optional course, the qualitative <br>discussion offered by the
        compulsory course is complemented by quantitative discussion in the <br>optional
        course. <br> <br>Learning and educational objectives <br> <br>This optional
        course is designed for students to: <br>1) enhance awareness of potential
        profession, most likely linked to scientific research; <br>2) identify physics

        used in describing the <br>micro world and the universe; <br>59 <br> <br>6)
        gain a creative view, based on knowledge of physics and critical thinking,

        oral and in written form  concerning the topics of nuclear physics, radiation
        <br>and cosmology; <br>8) develop attitudes valuing knowledge of nuclear physics,

        demanding higher-level mental processes, and learning new knowledge <br>and
        skills integrating various subjects based on the scientific core of modern
        social science <br>problems. Sustainable development is reflected in skills
        and attitudes that help the students to grow <br>into conscious and active
        citizens who are able to value alternative solutions while giving reasons
        for <br>61 <br> <br>their choices, working out action plans to achieve their
        aims and participating in realising these plans <br>using their knowledge
        of science. <br> <br>The structure of this course consists of three levels:
        introducing the issue in everyday situations, <br>gaining new knowledge through
        an exploratory approach to solving scientific problems, and making <br>socio-scientific

        of these modules is constantly being updated using new <br>developments in
        science and technology and considering the needs of our knowledge-based society,
        <br>and new modules are also developed in collaboration between teachers and
        scientists. All of the <br>modules are tied to the three fields – society,
        technology and the sciences – but they are also <br>integrated with other
        subjects, including social subjects. <br> <br> <br>Learning and educational
        objectives <br> <br>This optional course is designed for students to: <br>1)
        through gained interdisciplinary knowledge, explain the achievements of the
        sciences and <br>their future trends; <br>2) combine their knowledge and skills
        gained from various science subjects to form an <br>integrated whole; <br>3)
        recognize scientific problems in ordinary life situations; <br>4)  find and
        evaluate information concerning scientific problems with social impact; <br>5)
        use scientific methods, including an investigatory approach, in considering
        real-life issues; <br>6) make reasoned socio- scientific decisions; <br>7)
        develop a creative and critical as well as an innovative way of thinking;
        <br>8) develop written and oral skills of communication in discussing social
        and scientific problems; <br>9) value scientific knowledge and be prepared
        for lifelong learning; and <br>10) evaluate risk factors and forecast the
        implications that scientific and technological <br>achievements may have on
        the environment. <br> <br> <br>Learning outcomes <br> <br>Learning outcomes
        describe the level of achievements for students. <br>By the end of the course,

        socio-scientifi cdecisions in solving social issues; <br>3) combine their

        <br>integrated whole; <br>4) explain the scientific background of social science
        problems discussed in the context of <br>modern sciences; <br>5) discuss issues
        in our everyday lives through write critical essays with a scientific content;
        <br>6) explain factors associated with the nature of science and technology
        and their role in <br>society, as well as their connections to science subjects;
        <br>62 <br> <br>7) give plans to solve scientific problems derived from socio-scientific
        issues, including <br>applying the method of definition cards; <br>8) plan

        and <br>evaluate their risk factors; <br>9) show willingness to work in a
        team and be tolerant in regard to the opinions of their team <br>mates; <br>10)
        value scientific problem-solving based on investigations and its role in deciding
        on socio-<br>scientific issues in the cultural context of Estonia; and <br>11)
        become intrinsically motivated to update their scientific knowledge throughout
        their lives. <br> <br>Learning content <br> <br>Final specifications of the
        learning content depend on the curricula of other science subjects and <br>other
        optional subjects. The aim is to avoid duplication in developing new knowledge
        and discussing <br>similar problems in different subjects using different
        methodology. The problems discussed affect the <br>lives of the students and
        are widely discussed in society, thus motivating the students to be more <br>eager
        to learn the definitions, theories and laws of chemistry, physics, biology
        and geography in a <br>context that describes modern sciences. The modules
        are divided between four fields – chemistry, <br>biology, physics and geography
        – and are as follows: <br>1. <br>Climate change: what will Estonia’s fate
        be? <br>2. <br>Viruses: what will the future be like? <br>3. <br>Holes in
        the ozone layer and ultraviolet radiation: is there a risk to life? <br>4.

        lives: are we making sensible decisions? <br>6. <br>Electromagnetic radiation:
        how does our domestic equipment influence our lives and health? <br>7. <br>Genetically
        modified food: is it good or bad for us? <br>8. <br>Alternative sources of
        energy: could biodiesel be a solution? <br>9. <br>Weight loss products: is
        the pharmaceutical industry really serving our interests? <br>10. <br>Traffic
        accidents: are they really caused by bad roads, high speed and drink-driving,
        or is <br>technology at fault? <br>11. <br>Poisonous chemicals around us:
        how great is the risk? <br>12. <br>Smells: is it all just perfumery? <br>13.
        <br>Alcometers, fat measuring devices, blood pressure and pulse measuring
        devices and other <br>similar machines: who are they for and why? The truth

        and dark or well-lit and cold? <br>15. <br>Is homemade soap viable in the
        modern world? <br>16. <br>The paper industry: is it a problem for Estonia
        as well? <br>These modules are presented as a set of learning materials. In
        addition, materials are compiled for <br>teachers to give them further information
        about methodological solutions and inter-subject scientific <br>information.

      label: 'Description of the course <br> <br>70 <br> <br>This course is provisionally
        a subject of informatics, but it focuses on the main questions of informatics
        in <br>quite a narrow context, directly limited by the needs of investigative  work,
        which acts as a substitute for <br>transition exams. Informatics is the branch
        of science and technology that looks at the structure of <br>information and
        the way it is formed, obtained, processed, interpreted and forwarded. In this

        find information from suitable sources, evaluate its reliability and compile
        accurate <br>reference items; <br>2) use references in text correctly; <br>3)
        compile a web-based questionnaire consisting of different types of question-and-answer
        <br>scales;    <br>4) organise a web-based poll and present the information
        collected as part of the <br>questionnaire as a table;  <br>5) code, sort
        and filter data in a database; ( <br>6) use a data table to compile cross-tables
        and frequency tables and different diagrams;   <br>7) present descriptive
        and statistical characteristics (means, standard deviation, minimum, <br>maximum

        power from a sample to the population of the hypothesis and the <br>validity
        of the null hypothesis using a suitable test; <br>9) present a correct research
        report; and <br>10) compile a presentation about this research report and
        make the presentation. <br> <br>Learning content <br> <br>The course is divided
        into seven modules, each consisting of five lessons; the last module is meant
        <br>for students’ independent work on their final report under the supervision
        of the teacher. The first six <br>modules focus on the following topics: <br>1.
        <br>Searching for information from the Internet and in libraries; working
        with sources and <br>referring to sources; writing reference items and managing
        references with special <br>software. <br>2. <br>Collecting investigative
        material; types of variables; types of questions and scales for <br>answers;
        using special software to compile a web-based questionnaire. <br>3. <br>Basics

        investigative report: tables, figures, styles, table of learning content,
        index, <br>headers, footers and footnotes; making and giving a presentation
        about the research <br>report.   <br> <br>Study Activities <br> <br>In planning
        and organizing curricular activities: <br>1) the starting point is basic values,
        general competences, the aims of the subject, the Learning <br>content of
        education and the expected results of the curriculum, while also supporting
        <br>integration with other subjects and recurrent topics; <br>2) the aim is
        to achieve a moderate learning load (including homework), which is divided
        evenly <br>throughout the school year and which leaves students with enough
        time for rest and recreational <br>activities; <br>3) the students are given
        the opportunity to learn individually and in groups (individual, pair and
        <br>group work) to support their development into active and independent learners;
        <br>4) differentiated study assignments are used whose essence and level of
        difficulty should support <br>an individualised approach and increase students’
        motivation to study; <br>5) standard office software, modern web-based learning
        environments and free web-based tools <br>and learning materials are used;
        <br>6) in data collecting, the learning environment is broadened outside of
        the computer class: natural <br>environments, libraries, the school yard,
        museums, exhibitions, enterprises, etc.; <br>7) practice exercises are done
        using databases given by the teacher; only in exceptional cases <br>can students
        use their own data, because usually this course is meant for the students
        to <br>prepare for their own investigative project, and not as part of their
        own investigation; <br>8) usually the students are not given homework demanding
        the use of a computer, in order to <br>guarantee equal possibilities and similar
        software for all; and <br>9) at the end of the course all students get the
        chance to present a summary of their investigation. <br> <br>Physical learning
        environment <br> <br>In the classroom, the students can use the following
        devices: <br>1) usually, every student has their own workplace with a computer;
        in exceptional cases <br>there may be up to two students per computer; <br>2)
        standard office software; <br>3) the students can use their own laptops (power
        supply, network connection and work <br>table); <br>4) presentation equipment;
        <br>5) the option to save files to a network drive or an Internet environment
        supported by the <br>school; <br>6) supplementary equipment (printer and memory
        stick); <br>7) access to information systems (e-school, intranet or web-based
        Learning content <br>management system and group-working environment); <br>8)
        computer workplaces with adjustable chairs, computer table, mechanical ventilation
        <br>system and window covers; <br>72 <br> <br>9) computers with different
        operation systems; <br>10) ID card facilities (card-reading device and software);
        <br>11) earphones and microphones; and <br>12) digital camera and video camera.
        <br> <br>Assessment <br> <br>The results of the optional courses of informatics
        are graded according to the current learning <br>achievements and, in summary,
        usually according to the e-portfolio compiled by the student. The e-<br>portfolio
        is a personal web-based environment where the students host their projects
        and reflections <br>of their learning experience compiled over a longer period.
        By the end of the course, students make <br>a selection offering the best
        proof of their competence from the materials kept in their e-portfolio and,
        <br>if possible, defend their work before an audience. Learning tasks and
        e-portfolios may be individual <br>or group-based. The grade received for
        defending the portfolio provides the summary grade for the <br>course. In
        the tasks and presentation of the e-portfolio, the following aspects are assessed:
        <br>1) the methodical, creative and rational learning process; <br>2) achieving
        the aims set by the curriculum, and giving convincing proof of the competences
        <br>associated with this curriculum; <br>3) technical, aesthetic and original
        realization of materials created with the help of a computer; <br>4) making
        sense of their own practical activities; and <br>5) the development of the
        students.'

      label: 'Applications’   <br> <br>Description of the course <br> <br>The main
        elements of the course are: <br>1) <br>principles of creating applications;
        <br>2) <br>models and basics of modelling; and <br>3) <br>basics of algorithms
        and programming. <br> <br>The parts and their topics are not presented one
        after the other, but rather the teacher finds a suitable <br>approach according
        to the programming tools available, the purpose of the course and considering
        their <br>methodical experience and preferences and other factors. <br>The
        principles and main stages of application creating are introduced through
        practical work: projects <br>containing elements of modelling, analysis and
        design. In modelling, the main aim is to compile and <br>present algorithms
        for projects realized with the help of Unified Modelling Language (UML). The
        <br>nature of class models may be discussed briefly and in a generalized form,
        taking into consideration <br>the students’ ability to read and understand
        the structures of the systems and data presented in <br>these models. The
        majority of the time is used to gain programming and algorithm skills through
        <br>practical work. <br> <br>To achieve the aims of this course, it is important
        to become aware of and experience the essence of <br>programmes and controlling
        by programmes, and for this, practical work of compiling programmes <br>and
        realizing them in computer environments is used. In order to facilitate and
        speed up this <br>process, while also avoiding the formation of reluctant
        attitudes in students, the first or only <br>programming language used should
        be a language with as simple a syntax as possible, and with an <br>attractive
        programming language or environment enabling the use of multimedia instruments.
        <br>73 <br> <br> <br>Recently, special languages and environments designed
        for learning programming (such as Scratch, <br>Alice, Game Maker and new generation
        languages based on Basic or Logo) have been developing <br>and spreading rapidly.
        These languages are good for teaching programming to children and <br>students.
        Compared with the traditional methods (such as Pascal), these new tools enable
        the <br>learners to acquire the main principles and skills of programming
        two to three times faster. <br>At present, the first environment (language)
        used could be the rapidly spreading software Scratch <br>(http://scratch.mit.edu),
        a tool created and developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
        (MIT). <br>This freeware is available on the Internet and includes a variety
        of teaching materials (including those in <br>Estonian and in Russian). Considering
        the aims and coverage of the course, other tools may be <br>introduced in
        addition to Scratch, such as Alice, MS Small Basic, application development
        system Visual <br>Basic (VBA) or Python.  <br> <br>The course should predominantly
        be oriented towards practical activities and using electronic <br>learning
        materials. <br> <br>Learning and educational objectives <br> <br>This optional
        course is designed for students to: <br>1) develop creativity, a logical,
        analytical and algorithmic way of thinking and systematic <br>discussion of
        problems and problem-solving; <br>2) acknowledge and experience the working
        principles of programme-controlled systems and <br>the nature of the main
        processes of presenting and processing information; <br>3) become familiar
        with using the instruments and the methods for creating applications and <br>programmes;
        <br>4) gain basic skills in writing programmes and algorithms and solving
        problems with the help of <br>programme-controlled systems; <br>5) be introduced
        to the principles of object-oriented modelling, analysis and design; <br>6)
        explain the nature of objects and data, their properties and the roles these
        properties play in <br>algorithms and programmes; and <br>7) acquire the main
        concepts and definitions of algorithms and programming, the skills to plan,
        <br>compile, smooth and test programmes consisting of interworking units (procedures),
        use <br>objects, scalar data and massifs and describe various processes. <br>
        <br> <br>Learning outcomes <br> <br>Learning outcomes at the upper secondary
        level describe the level of achievement of students. <br>By the end of the
        course, students are expected to have the capacity to: <br>1) distinguish
        between and describe the main stages of creating an application: setting the
        <br>task, analysing, designing and realizing; <br>2) compare and evaluate
        various tools and methods for creating applications; <br>3) explain the main
        terms of object-oriented modelling, analysis and design and understand <br>the
        class and operation diagrams of the Unified Modelling Language (UML); <br>4)
        create, write, fill, smooth and test programmes; <br>5) distinguish between
        different types of data (numbers, texts, Boolean, graphic and sound <br>data)
        and use them in programmes and algorithms and have some idea of their <br>presentation
        methods; <br>6) explain the nature of constants, variables, massifs and objects
        and use them rationally in <br>algorithms and programmes; <br>74 <br> <br>7)
