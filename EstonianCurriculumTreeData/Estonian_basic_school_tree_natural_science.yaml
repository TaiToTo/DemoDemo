      label: The subjects in the natural science domain are designed to enhance scientific
        and technological literacy. In <br>so doing these subjects  promote the study
        of the properties and effects of biological, geographical, <br>chemical, physical
        and technological phenomena and processes in the environment, as well as the
        <br>connections between them. The teaching approach, advocated in this domain,
        and the student-centred <br>study processes connected to it are based on social
        constructivism, which means that by being involved in <br>solving scientific
        problems related to environmental issues the students acquire an overview
        of natural <br>science facts and theories, as well as professions connected
        to them. Active creative work in the field of <br>natural sciences develops
        the natural science world view of basic school pupils and helps them make
        <br>career choices.  <br>It is important for studies in this domain to motivate
        students and develop their interest in nature, through <br>the identification
        of environmental problems and the determining of ways to solve them. Studies
        focus on <br>solving scientific problems using appropriate scientific methods,
        which involve observation of phenomena <br>and processes, determination of
        the problems, collection and evaluation of background information, <br>formulation
        of scientific questions and hypotheses, planning of problem solving experiments
        carrying them <br>out using appropriate observation and recording of data,
        analysing and drawing conclusions from the data <br>obtained and presenting
        summaries orally and in writing. This requires the acquisition of scientific
        skills and <br>the development of higher levels of thinking.  <br> <br>Integration
        of subjects within the domain is intended to shape the students’ understanding
        of nature as a <br>whole, including connections and causal effects.  <br>
        <br>The study of Science forms the basis for students’ studies in the other
        natural science subjects (Biology, <br>Physics, Geography and Chemistry) and
        provides an introduction to a scientific way of thinking. The <br>students
        learn to identify and purposefully observe the animate and inanimate objects
        and phenomena of <br>nature, gather and analyse data and draw conclusions
        on the basis of this data. Through practical activities, <br>the students
        learn to find different solutions to problems and through decision making
        involving society-<br>based perspectives, analyse their possible consequences.
        <br> <br>The study of Biology as a natural science subject allows students
        to gain an understanding of  phenomena <br>and processes of nature and the
        connections between living and non-living natural. <br> <br>The study of Geography
        shape the students’ understanding of spatial distribution and mutual connections  <br>of
        phenomena and processes taking place in nature and the society.  <br> <br>Studying
        the Physics students acquire an understanding of physical processes and the
        possibilities of <br>applying laws of physics to the development of technology
        and biological functions. <br> <br>Through studies in the subject of Chemistry
        students acquire knowledge about structure and properties of <br>substances
        and chemical phenomena, as well as an ability to understand patterns within
        chemical <br>processes that take place in nature and human activity.  <br>
        <br>Choices about discussing the learning contents are made by the subject
        teacher, considering that the <br>learning outcomes, general competencies,
        subject field and subject competencies described by stages of <br>study would
        be achieved.

        an overview of connections and <br>mutual interactions present in the natural
        environment, as well as the effect of human activity on the <br>environment.
        All general competencies described in the general part of the national curriculum
        are <br>developed by teaching natural sciences. In developing the four interrelated
        components differentiated in <br>competences - knowledge, skills, values and
        behaviour - the teacher holds the central role as his/her <br>values and ability
        to establish himself/herself create a suitable learning environment and affect
        the values <br>and behaviour of students. <br> <br>Cultural and value competence.
        A positive attitude towards all living things and the environment is <br>established,
        interest towards natural sciences as a cultural phenomenon providing new knowledge
        and <br>solutions is created, the importance of natural diversity and the
        need to protect it acknowledged, <br>sustainable and responsible way of live
        valued and healthful lifestyles formed.  <br>Social and citizenship competence.
        Students learn to evaluate the impact of human activities to the <br>natural
        environment, acknowledge local and global environmental issues and find solutions
        for them. <br>Importance is given to solving dilemma problems, where decisions
        have to be made considering science <br>perspectives as well as aspects related
        to human society – legislative, economical and ethical and moral <br>perspectives.
        Social competencies are also developed in active learning methods used in
        natural sciences: <br>group work in problem based learning and solving dilemma
        problems, analysis of observation and test <br>results and oral presentation
        of outcomes.  <br>Self-awareness competence. Biology lessons, which examine
        issues associated with the human <br>anatomy, physiology and healthy lifestyles
        explain the individual needs for energy and food intake, <br>individuality
        in healthy exercise, risks related to falling ill and different aspects of
        healthy lifestyles.  <br>Learning to learn competence. Different study activities
        develop the skills of solving problems and <br>implementing investigation
        based learning are developed through different study activities: students
        acquire <br>the skills for finding natural science information, formulating
        problems and inquiry questions, planning and <br>carrying out experiments
        or observations and drawing conclusions. The development of learning to learn
        <br>competences is supported by ICT-based learning environments, which enable
        applying different learning <br>strategies by providing quick and individualised
        feedback. <br> <br>Communication competence. An important part in the study
        activities is played by searching for natural <br>science information from
        different courses including the Internet, analysing the information found
        and <br>evaluating its veracity. The accurate formulation and written and
        oral presentations on results from <br>observations and experiments. Also
        all natural sciences develop the accurate use of terms and symbols <br>characteristic
        of the corresponding science domains both in abstract scientific and in concrete
        everyday <br>contexts. <br> <br> Mathematics and natural sciences and technology
        competence. Students learn to understand natural <br>science problems, the
        importance of science and technology and their impact on the society, use
        new <br>technology and technological tools for solving study task and to make
        evidence based decisions in <br>everyday life. All natural science subjects
        also involve preparing and analysing numerical figures, <br>comparing and
        making associations between different objects and processes. In investigation
        based <br>learning the data from experiments or observations are presented
        as table and numerical figures and <br>associations are made between the numerical
        indicators and the problem being solved.  <br> <br>Entrepreneurial competence.
        Going through the applied science topics of natural sciences, the everyday
        <br>reliance on the transference of abstract scientific facts and theories
        emerges. Along with that, the students <br>gain an overview of professions
        related to the natural sciences and the research institutions and companies
        <br>active in the corresponding field. The development of entrepreneurial
        competences is supported by an <br>investigation based approach to study,
        where experiments and observations are planned and analysed <br>systematically.
        An important role is also played by the solving of dilemmas related to the
        environment and <br>making competent decisions, which aside from scientific
        perspectives take into account also social aspects.'

      label: Language and literature, including foreign languages. Studying natural
        sciences and working with texts <br>on natural sciences develops the students’
        skills of understanding and analysing text. Creating different <br>texts,
        e.g. reports, presentations etc. develops the skill of expressing oneself
        clearly and relevantly both <br>orally and in writing. Students are taught
        to use appropriate language tools, subject vocabulary and <br>expressive language
        and to follow grammatical requirements. The students’ skill to look up information
        from <br>different sources and to critically evaluate this information is
        developed. Attention is turned to the correct <br>formalization and referencing
        in the works and the protection of intellectual property. Natural science
        terms <br>originating from foreign languages are explained and foreign language
        skills developed also when looking <br>up and understanding additional material.

        by formulation of research results, making <br>presentations, going to exhibitions,
        valuing the beauty of nature in study trips etc. <br> <br>Technology. Learning
        to understand the simplest patterns of the functioning of nature as a system
        and the <br>effects of humans and technology on the natural environment develops
        the technological competence of <br>students. Knowledge in physics creates
        a theoretical basis for understanding the connections between <br>nature,
        instruments and technology. Technological competence is developed using technological
        tools <br>(including information and communication technology) in teaching.
        <br> <br>Physical education. Studying natural sciences supports giving value
        to physical activity and healthy <br>lifestyles.

        label: 'Science is promoted as a subject that integrates the study of knowledge,
          skills, attitudes and values <br>associated with the science subjects of
          Biology, Physics, Geography and Chemistry. <br> <br>Enhancing scientific
          and technological literacy focuses on developing following competencies:
          <br>1) applying science knowledge to everyday life (knowledge of science
          − knowledge of the different <br>scientific disciplines and the natural
          world and knowledge about science as a form of human <br>inquiry, scientific
          explanations, science and technology); <br>2) applying practical skills
          and application of scientific methods to solve scientific problems related
          to <br>everyday life –and <br>3) utilising attitudes and values in dealing
          with scientific issues – belief in one’s abilities and self-<br>confidence
          in studying science, interest in studying science and in careers in science,
          readiness to <br>make justified decisions associated with  everyday issues
          and taking responsibility as an informed <br>citizen for sustainable development.
          <br> <br>The studying of science allow students to begin to acquire an understanding
          of nature as a whole. In <br>studying science, students gain competencies
          in observing natural objects, phenomena and processes and <br>exploring
          the connections between them.  Students learn to recognize the relations
          in nature recognising <br>and appreciating  patterns in the way nature functions,
          the dependence of human beings on the natural <br>environment and the effects
          of human activities on the natural environment; understanding  that every
          <br>phenomenon happens for a reason and that any change in nature brings
          about other changes which may <br>be both desirable and undesirable; in
          acquiring a positive attitude towards all forms of life, and  developing
          <br>a desire and readiness to protect the natural environment and form sustainable
          values and attitudes. <br> <br>Science develops competencies associated
          with critical and creative thinking: the students learn how to <br>notice
          and observe in a purposeful way; ask questions; gather data and organise
          this in a systematic way; <br>analyse and draw conclusions, making generalisations;
          predict the consequences of solutions and <br>decisions within the environment.  <br>
          <br>Organisation of studies is based on experiencing nature directly and
          age appropriate activities. Planning <br>studies is based on the scientifically
          and importance of the problems raised, which in lessons is organized <br>as
          practical activities with natural objects or their models. The learning
          environment is active, student-<br>centred and problem based. The studies
          are related to everyday life and contribute to shaping internal <br>studying
          motivation. <br>At the 1st stage of study, the students mainly get to know
          their surroundings and everyday phenomena.  <br>The students develop an
          interest in nature and the ability to behave properly in nature. By the
          end of this <br>stage of study, the students move from describing natural
          phenomena towards making simpler connections <br>and drawing conclusions.
          General teaching and subject teaching may be combined (in addition to subject-<br>specific
          teaching). The main practical activities that guarantee the achievement
          of the learning outcomes of <br>this stage of study are investigation-based
          and practical activities: observing objects (including natural <br>objects),
          comparing, grouping, measuring, making experiments, making collections and
          using plans.  <br> <br>At the 2nd stage of study, the students continue
          developing their scientific inquiry skills. They develop the <br>ability
          to think scientifically and creatively, solve problems and formulate scientific
          questions and <br>hypotheses that can be verified using small-scale experiments.
          The students develop positive attitudes <br>towards the environment. <br>
          <br>At the 3rd stage of study, the students learn to describe objects and
          phenomena quantitatively and develop <br>skills in processing information
          analytically. The students develop their competence in understanding the
          <br>phenomena and methods used in examining these in science. <br> <br>At
          both the 2nd and 3rd stages of study, it is important to maintain the students’
          motivation towards study <br>and to shape their interest in science, science-related
          careers and their understanding of the importance of <br>science and technology
          in our everyday lives. To develop competence in attitudes, different study
          methods <br>are used, including situation- and role play.  It is important
          to plan investigation-based assignments that <br>follow the interests and
          experiences of the students. In developing investigation skills, special
          attention is <br>paid to planning and carrying out studies and analysing,
          interpreting and presenting results. In addition to <br>practical and inquiry-based
          activities, the students solve various theoretical tasks which guarantee
          the <br> <br>10<br>development of thinking skills at a higher level. With
          homework the students consolidate what they learn in <br>the classroom and
          apply this to activities in everyday life. The studying environment must
          provide <br>possibilities for the students to be creative.'

        label: 'Geography is an integrated subject which belongs to both the natural
          science (Natural Geography) and <br>social sciences (Human Geography). The
          students rely on the knowledge, skills and attitudes acquired in <br>Science,
          and integrate Mathematics, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, History and Civic
          Studies. In studying <br>Geography, the students develop scientific and
          technology literacy, the students acquire an understanding <br>of the Earth
          as a whole and the mutual effects between the environment and human activities.
          An important <br>role is played by skills of solving problems and making
          justified decisions. The knowledge, skills and <br>attitudes acquired in
          Geography and other natural and social sciences form the basis for internally
          <br>motivated lifelong learning. <br>The main aim of basic school Geography
          is for students to gain an overview of the phenomena and <br>processes taking
          place in nature and society and their spatial distribution and connections
          by studying <br>certain areas as examples. The emphasis is on the importance
          of preserving natural and cultural diversity <br>and the need to research
          this. The students acquire an understanding of science as a process which
          <br> <br>41<br>creates knowledge and provides explanations about their surroundings.
          At the same time, the students’ <br>inquiry and problem-solving skills are
          developed. <br>In studying Geography, it is important to develop an understanding
          of the connections between humans <br>and the environment, the limited nature
          of natural resources and the need to use them rationally. The <br>students’
          environmental awareness is developed: they adopt a sustainable lifestyle
          and gain an idea of <br>sustainable development, plus attitudes that value
          the environment, which is looked at in its widest <br>meaning, including
          the natural, economic, social and cultural environment. <br>Geography plays
          an important role in shaping the students’ values and attitudes. Approaches
          to world <br>nature, population and cultural geography form a basis for
          an understanding and tolerant attitude towards <br>the cultures and traditions
          of other countries and peoples. Studying Estonian Geography forms a basis
          for <br>valuing the nature, history and cultural heritage of the students’
          homeland. <br>In order to cope in the fierce competition of a globalising
          world, people need to know different areas of the <br>world – their economies,
          cultures and traditions – better, primarily for studying, working and recreation.
          <br>Studying Geography helps to shape the self-definition of students as
          active citizens of Estonia, Europe and <br>the world. <br>In studying Geography,
          the students acquire skills in map-reading and use information technology,
          the <br>need for which is growing in today’s mobile society. <br>The material
          studied is presented in a problem-based way as much as possible and in connection
          with the <br>students’ everyday lives and home areas. In the studies, the
          individual specificities of the students are <br>taken into account and
          their abilities are developed from diverse perspectives. Significant attention
          is paid <br>to shaping the studying motivation of students, and in order
          to achieve this various interactive study <br>methods are used: problem-based
          and research-based studying, project work, discussions, brainstorming, <br>role
          plays, studies outside of the classroom, study visits etc. At all stages
          of study, technological <br>instruments and information and communication
          technology are used. <br>With research-based study the students learn how
          to formulate problems and hypotheses, plan work, carry <br>out observations,
          measure and process, interpret and present results. An important role is
          played by the <br>skill of using different sources of information (including
          the Internet) and critically assessing the information <br>they find there.'

        label: 'Physics is a natural science and plays an important part in shaping
          the students’ literacy in science- and <br>technology-related issues. Physics
          explains natural phenomena, creates corresponding models and is <br>closely
          connected to mathematics. Physics forms a basis for understanding instruments
          and technology <br>and helps students to value technological professions.
          <br>The Physics Learning in basic school only studies a small proportion
          of physical phenomena and forms a <br>basis from which to later develop
          a complete picture of physics as a natural science. In studying physics,
          <br> <br>51<br>the students obtain a preliminary overview of the language
          of physics and learn to use it. The things studied <br>are associated with
          everyday life, mathematical skills, instruments and technology and other
          natural <br>sciences. <br>In studying physics, the main focus is on integrating
          natural sciensesscience (Physics, Chemistry, Biology <br>and Geography)
          from two directions. Vertically, these subjects are integrated through common
          topics, such <br>as development (evolution), interaction, movement (changing
          and transformation), systems and structures, <br>energy, technology and
          the environment (society). Vertical integration is supported by the specificity
          of the <br>area, taking into account the horizontal integration of the subjects.
          <br>The values of students are shaped by associating the solutions to problems
          with the general <br>cultural/historic context. At the same time, the role
          of physicists in the history of science is studied as well <br>as the meaning
          of physics and its applications for the development of humankind. <br>In
          the studying process the students develop skills that are needed for successful
          studies (of physics). <br>Solving calculus-, graphics- or problem-based
          tasks and assessing how realistic the results are creates a <br>basis for
          critical thinking. When learning about phenomena, experiments are preferred;
          when solving <br>problems, scientific method are used. <br>The material
          studied is presented in a problem-based way as much as possible and in connection
          with the <br>students’ everyday lives. In the studies, the individual specificities
          of the students are taken into account <br>and their abilities are developed
          from diverse perspectives. Significant attention is paid to shaping the
          <br>studying motivation of students, and in order to achieve this various
          interactive study methods are used: <br>problem-based and research-based
          studying, project work, discussions, brainstorming, role plays, study <br>outside
          of the classroom, study visits etc. When planning studies, the teacher may
          change the order of the <br>topics studied, wherein it is important to note
          that the changed order of topics follows the developmental <br>specificities
          of the students and that the teaching takes place according to the principle
          of the growth of <br>abstraction. When changing the order of themes, the
          students’ motivation to study physics must be <br>guaranteed (and this should,
          hopefully, see them achieve better results). At all stages of study, <br>technological
          instruments and information and communication technology are used. <br>With
          research-based study the students learn how to formulate problems and hypotheses,
          plan work, carry <br>out observations, measure and process, interpret and
          present results. An important role is played by oral <br>and written presentation
          of research results, including verbal and visual forms of presentation.
          An important <br>role is also played by the skill of using different sources
          of information (including the Internet) and critically <br>assessing the
          information found there.'

        label: '61<br>Chemistry is a natural science and plays an important role in
          the shaping of students’ scientific and <br>technology literacy. The study
          of chemistry is based on the knowledge, skills and attitudes acquired in
          other <br>subjects (Science, Physics, Biology, Mathematics et al.), at the
          same time supporting the teaching of other <br>subjects.  <br> <br>In studying
          chemistry, the students acquire a simple but complete understanding of the
          chemical processes <br>that take place in nature and artificial environments
          as well as those used in human activities, their relations <br>and their
          effects on the living environment. The skills of solving everyday life problems
          and making <br>competent decisions are important, as they form the basis
          for coping in the natural and social <br>environments. The knowledge, skills
          and attitudes acquired in chemistry, integrated with that studied in <br>other
          subjects, form a basis for internally motivated lifelong learning. <br>
          <br>In studying chemistry the students acquire an overview of the contemporary
          technology- and energy-<br>related problems and future directions in chemistry,
          which help the students in their future choice of <br>profession. The study
          of chemistry develops the students’ understanding about relations between
          a clean <br>natural environment and health. Studying chemistry shapes the
          students’ sense of responsibility and <br>respect towards nature and develops
          an ability to assess the direct or indirect consequences of one’s <br>decisions
          or activities. <br> <br>In study, a inquiry-based approach based on scientific
          method is used, solving problems arising from the <br>natural, technological
          and social environments. The studies develop the skills of a creative approach,
          <br>logical thinking, understanding causal relations, analysis and generalisation.  <br>
          <br>The students acquire an ability to understand and compile chemistry-related
          texts, make sense of and use <br>chemistry-related vocabulary correctly,
          present chemistry-related information by the oral and written <br>presentation
          using different verbal and visual forms of presentation (verbally and as
          diagrams, graphs, <br>models and formulas) and used different sources of
          information, including electronic ones. <br> <br>Through practical work,
          the students acquire the skills they need for such work: learning how to
          safely use <br>instruments for experiments and the chemicals necessary in
          everyday life and assessing the danger of <br>everyday chemicals and materials
          used in everyday life and technology for human health and the state of <br>the
          natural environment. Solving chemistry calculus problems deepens the students’
          understanding of <br>chemistry problems and develops skills of logical thinking
          and mathematical applications and teaches the <br>students to understand
          the quantitative relations between chemical phenomena and draw conclusions
          and <br>make decisions based on these. In the studies, significant attention
