      label: 'The ‘Foreign languages’ subject field comprises foreign languages, including
        Estonian learned as a second <br>language in schools where the language of
        instruction is not Estonian. <br>In upper secondary school students learn,
        at proficiency level B, at least two foreign languages, which are <br>chosen
        from the following: English, French, German, Russian or another language.
        There is one <br>compulsory foreign language in upper secondary schools where
        Estonian is taught as a second language <br>in accordance with the school’s
        curriculum. <br> <br>The foreign languages at B1 and B2 levels of proficiency
        are chosen by schools. In forming foreign <br>language groups, the abilities
        and preferences of students and the school’s resources are taken into <br>account.  <br>
        <br>The foreign language at the B2 level of proficiency is a language in which
        the student has reached a higher <br>level of proficiency during previous
        studies (e.g. B1 by graduating from basic school) and in which they aim <br>to
        reach the B2 level of proficiency irrespective of whether the language to
        be learned was an A, B or C <br>language in basic school or whether the student
        had studied the language outside of school. <br> <br>The foreign language
        at B1 level of proficiency is a language which starts from a lower level of
        language <br>proficiency (e.g. A2 by graduating from basic school). Students
        aim to reach at least the B1 level of <br>proficiency irrespective of whether
        the language to be learned was an A, B or C language in basic school or <br>whether
        the student had studied the language outside of school. <br>2 <br> <br> <br>If
        the school’s curriculum contains a third foreign language (e.g., at proficiency
        level A), it is advisable to <br>teach French, German, Russian or another
        foreign language which corresponds to the students’ <br>preferences and the
        school’s resources. The courses are divided into compulsory and optional courses.
        <br> <br>The volumes of compulsory subject courses are as follows:  <br>1)
        Estonian as a second language   <br> <br> 9 <br>2) Foreign language at B1
        level of proficiency <br> 5 <br>3) Foreign language at B2 level of proficiency  <br>
        5 <br> <br>The volumes of optional courses are as follows:  <br>1) Foreign
        language at B1 level of proficiency  <br>4 <br>2) Foreign language at B2 level
        of proficiency  <br>2 <br> <br>Depending on the learners’ abilities and the
        initial level of language proficiency, the number of compulsory <br>courses
        enables students to achieve satisfactory or good results at the target level
        of the foreign language <br>they have selected. In order to refine and practise
        skills corresponding to the B1 or B2 levels of language <br>proficiency and
        to move towards the next level of proficiency, schools offer their students
        optional and <br>additional courses in line with the school’s curriculum.'

      label: 'The aim concerning language policy is to achieve command of at least
        two foreign languages at the level of <br>independent language user (Level
        B). Foreign language skills support the ability to understand and value <br>the
        multicultural world and expand opportunities for self-expression through various
        linguistic and non-<br>linguistic means. The study of foreign languages develops
        systematic thinking. The aim of language <br>instruction is to broaden the
        individual’s command of languages, since learning one foreign language <br>facilitates
        acquiring another. Thus the range of languages should be broad so that students
        can develop <br>their language competences in several languages. <br>The study
        of foreign languages is based on the Common European Framework of Reference
        for <br>Languages and the language proficiency levels set out therein. The
        learning outcomes for all foreign <br>languages, incl. Estonian as the second
        language, have been specified on a uniform basis based on the <br>framework
        document. The learning outcomes in constituent skills are specified at the
        end of the subject <br>syllabus in Clause 2.3 of the table of language proficiency
        levels. Application of the principles of the <br>framework document in education
        makes it possible to consider age-related and individual characteristics <br>of
        students, establish feasible learning goals for students with different speeds
        of learning, and provide <br>feedback on achievements to support learning
        motivation and development of independent learning skills. <br>Language studies
        are not limited to reaching a certain level of proficiency by a certain time.
        It is essential to <br>support students’ motivation, develop their skills,
        build up their confidence and practise the language <br>outside the school,
        since this creates conditions for lifelong learning. Language learning is
        a continuous <br>process and is only successful if it is consistent. <br>As
        a foreign language is primarily a means to obtain information and to transfer
        it in communication, the <br>learning of languages focuses on content areas
        that facilitate development of communicative competence. <br>3 <br> <br>The
        content areas are shared in all foreign languages, with any differences arising
        from the targeted level <br>of proficiency and duration of study. Communicative
        competence is shaped by developing four constituent <br>language skills –
        listening, reading, speaking and writing – and, therefore, detailed learning
        outcomes are <br>specified by constituent skills. Different constituent skills
        are taught in an integrated manner. <br>Integration of foreign languages,
        particularly Estonian as a second language, with other subjects and <br>creation
        of a learning environment that facilitates learning support, in addition to
        acquisition of <br>communicative competence, also the development of a worldview,
        self-esteem and value-based behaviour. <br>Students are taught to compare
        their language and culture to other languages and cultures and understand
        <br>and value their uniqueness, and are discouraged from developing biased
        attitudes towards anything <br>foreign. Being familiar with other cultures
        helps students perceive the specifics of native culture and <br>language more
        knowledgeably. “Plurilingualism has itself to be seen in the context of pluriculturalism.
        <br>Language is not only a major aspect of culture, but also a means of access
        to cultural manifestations. The <br>various cultures (national, regional,
        social) to which the person has gained access do not simply co-exist <br>side
        by side; they are compared, contrasted and actively interact.”[1] The learner
        does not simply acquire <br>two distinct, unrelated ways of acting and communicating.
        They become plurilingual and develop <br>intercultural awareness. The language
        and cultural competences in respect of each language are modified <br>by the
        knowledge of others and contribute to intercultural awareness, skills and
        know-how[2]. <br> <br>Foreign language teaching requires an open and flexible
        methodological approach to adapt instruction <br>according to students’ needs.
        The essential principles of learner-centred teaching of foreign languages
        are: <br>1) learners’ active participation in the study process, their knowledgeable
        and creative use of foreign <br>languages and the formation of learning strategies;
        <br>2) accord between the content of the study materials used in language
        teaching and learners’ <br>interests; <br>3) use of different forms of active
        learning (including pair and group work); <br>4) the changed role of teachers
        from intermediaries of knowledge to partners who guide students in <br>the
        acquiring knowledge; and <br>5) versatile study materials, adjusted and revised,
        and based on the needs and goals of the learners.'

      label: 'The following interrelated components are distinguished in the competences:
        knowledge, skills, value <br>judgements and conduct. Teachers play a central
        role in teaching the four components, as their value <br>judgements and assertive
        abilities build an appropriate learning environment and influence the value
        <br>judgements and conduct of their students. The subject field of foreign
        languages comprises language <br>competences, culture (value judgements and
        conduct) and learning skills. By teaching the foreign <br>languages, all general
        competences (value, social, self-determination, learning, communication, <br>mathematics
        and entrepreneurial competence) are developed by following the aims set and
        themes to be <br>examined and by implementing different teaching methods and
        study activities. <br> <br>Cultural and value competence is developed by guiding
        students to value human relations and actions <br>from the perspective of
        generally applicable moral standards and ethics; to value the cultural heritage
        of <br>their own country and other countries, current cultural events, human
        and cultural diversity; to value <br>generally accepted human and social values,
        incl. tolerance and cooperation, thereby acknowledging their <br>values.  <br>4
        <br> <br>Social and citizenship competence enables students to fulfil their
        ambitions in society. In order to cope in <br>different everyday communication
        situations, it is essential to choose appropriate linguistic forms but also
        to <br>know the cultural background and the consequent rules of conduct and
        social practices and diversity of the <br>countries where the respective foreign
        language is spoken. Thus, social competence also relates to value <br>competence.
        The formation of social competence is facilitated by using different forms
        of study (e.g. group <br>work and project-based teaching) and active participation
        in cultural programmes related to the language <br>learned. <br>Self-awareness
        competence is developed through content topics and activities used in foreign
        language <br>study. The issues related to personality and human relations
        can be examined in foreign language lessons <br>through discussions, role
        plays and other learning activities that contribute to the students’ deeper
        self-<br>understanding. The ability to assess one’s strengths and weaknesses,
        to consider one’s abilities and <br>opportunities, to analyse one’s behaviour
        in different situation is closely related to the development of <br>learning
        competence.  <br>Learning to learn competence is developed by guiding students
        to use different learning strategies, see <br>the links between new and previously
        acquired knowledge and to apply the contents of learning in different <br>situations,
        to analyse one’s knowledge and skills (e.g., based on the principles of the
        European language <br>portfolio), to plan one’s studies and to follow the
        plan.  <br>Communication competence plays a central role in foreign language
        studies. The objectives of foreign <br>language teaching proceed directly
        from the components of communication competence and their content. <br>Good
        text comprehension, self-expression and text creation skills are prerequisites
        of successful <br>communication in foreign languages. Together with communication
        competences, students develop the <br>skill to compare the similarities and
        differences between their own and foreign cultures and to understand <br>and
        value the specific features of other cultures and languages, to be tolerant
        and avoid a prejudiced <br>attitude towards the unfamiliar.   <br>Mathematics,
        natural sciences and technology competence is associated with foreign language
        <br>through communication competence. As the students’ language proficiency
        increases, they learn to <br>understand texts from different walks of life
        and activities, incl. information graphics or other types of visual <br>information.
        Students are guided to see the importance and impact of natural sciences and
        technology on <br>everyday life, nature and society; to perceive social changes
        associated with the use of digital tools; to <br>adopt a critical approach
        to available information and to behave in a responsible manner when using
        <br>interactive media. Students are guided to use digital tools in a creative,
        innovative and purposeful manner.     <br>Entrepreneurial competence is associated
        primarily with the confidence and courage, which is provided <br>by foreign
        language proficiency and the knowledge and skills obtained in various areas
        of life and activity <br>through this proficiency.  The ability to cope in
        a foreign-language environment creates the preconditions <br>for cooperation
        with peers and other persons sharing the same views who speak the same foreign
        <br>language; foreign language proficiency expands students’ opportunities
        for implementing their ideas and <br>achieving their goals, as well as for
        contributing to problem-solving by responding to changes in a creative, <br>innovative
        and flexible manner.'

        in addition to knowledge of <br>numbers and calculation skills, by development
        of the ability to understand, associate and communicate <br>the information
        presented in symbols, charts, tables and diagrams in various source texts.
        Both fields <br>contribute to the development of functional reading skills,

        and accurate self-expression. <br>Nature Sciences and Social studies. Integration
        is achieved through different content areas, the source <br>texts and learning
        activities used. Foreign language education guides students, among other things,
        to <br>value natural diversity and a responsible and sustainable lifestyle;
        to recognise distinctive cultural features <br>and follow generally accepted
        rules of conduct; to acquire knowledge of civic rights and responsibilities;
        to <br>develop personal opinions and act as active and responsible citizens.
        <br>Art subjects. A connection with art competence is created through development
        of cultural awareness by <br>learning about cultural achievements of different
        countries through particular topics as well as through <br>direct experiences
        of art (cinema, theatre, concerts, music, exhibitions, museums, etc.). Students
        are <br>guided to notice and value different cultural traditions and the diversity
        of arts and cultural diversity of the <br>world. <br>Physical education. Physical
        education competence is associated with foreign languages through <br>appreciation
        of a healthy lifestyle and physical activity. Foreign language education (like
        physical <br>education) requires a tolerant attitude towards one’s peers,
        compliance with fair play rules and ability to <br>cooperate.

        These topics are first <br>and foremost related to the following thematic
        areas: <br>1) lifelong learning and career planning: subject fields ‘Education
        and Work’ & ‘The Individual and <br>Society’. Different forms of study are
        used to develop students’ independent learning skills and <br>responsibility,
        which form the foundation of lifelong learning habits and attitudes, as well
        as <br>communication and cooperation skills, which are also important for
        future employment. Foreign <br>language learning helps to acquire the vocabulary

        <br>6 <br> <br>education opportunities, and gain the ability to understand
        and prepare documents required for applying <br>for further studies and employment;
        <br>2) environment and sustainable development: subject fields ‘The Environment
        and Technology’ & ‘The <br>Individual and Society’. Students train decision-making
        and assessment in environmental issues, taking <br>into account the opportunities
        (and restrictions) of modern research and technology, as well as <br>economic
        considerations. Students develop readiness for engaging with environmental
        protection <br>issues as critical citizens at personal, social and global
        levels and for implementing nature-conserving <br>and sustainable methods
        of action and management; <br>3) civil initiative and entrepreneurship: subject
        fields ‘Estonia and the World’, ‘Education and Work’ & <br>‘The Individual
        and Society’. Students are guided to understand the functioning principles
        of society and <br>the importance of civic initiative, the role of entrepreneurship
        in society and the related effects, and to <br>develop personal opinions on
        related ethical issues. The main objective in upper secondary school is to
        <br>develop necessary practical skills for making decisions at local and national
        level and participation in <br>economic life;  <br>4) cultural identity: subject
        fields ‘Estonia and the World’, ‘Culture and Creation’ & ‘The Individual and
        <br>Society’. Education continues to support appreciation of own culture,
        interest in other cultures and <br>unprejudiced and conscious attitude towards
        the others. Students’ knowledge of different cultures is <br>expanded and
        synthesised in different subject lessons to form an integrated whole; the
        opportunities of <br>literature, the Internet, media and direct experiences
        are used for learning more about different nations <br>and cultures. Students
        are encouraged to think about the issues associated with living in another
        <br>cultural sphere; <br>5) information environment: subject fields ‘The Environment
        and Technology’ & ‘The Individual and <br>Society’. Students are guided to
        make and justify their independent choices as media consumers, <br>based on
        their interests and needs; to reflect on the rules of conduct in the public
        sphere; to understand <br>the role of media industry in society and the impact
        of globalisation on the content of media and media <br>usage patterns of the
        people.  <br>6) technology and innovation: subject fields ‘The Environment
        and Technology’ & ‘The Individual and <br>Society’. Students are guided to
        understand the impact of technological innovation on work and lifestyle, <br>the
        quality of life and the environment, thereby forming personal opinions on
        related ethical issues. The <br>goal is to develop positive attitudes about
        technological innovation and the associated career <br>opportunities, readiness
        to use information and communication technology for solving practical <br>problems
        and for increasing the efficiency of studies and work;  <br>7) health and
        safety: subject fields ‘The Environment and Technology’ & ‘The Individual
        and Society’. The <br>aim is students’ development into mentally, emotionally,
        socially and physically healthy members of <br>society who can observe a healthy
        lifestyle, behave in a safe manner and contribute to the development <br>of
        a health-promoting and safe environment; <br>8) values and morality: all subject
        fields. Students are guided to reflect on personal values and ethical <br>beliefs;
        to respect different viewpoints and to defend and justify their positions;
        to understand the value <br>of diversity. Education focuses on development
        of critical thinking and argumentation skills, collection <br>and generalisation
        of relevant information by highlighting links with different fields, previously
        acquired <br>knowledge and experiences, and issues of value systems and worldviews.'

        for a lifelong study of foreign languages. Assessment is based on the provisions
        of the <br>general part of the national curriculum for upper secondary schools.
        Diverse forms of assessment should <br>be used for measuring learning outcomes.
        Students’ knowledge and skills are assessed on the basis of <br>oral responses
        (presentations), written and/or practical work, taking into account the conformity
        of <br>knowledge and skills with the required learning outcomes specified
        in subject syllabi. All aspects of <br>language proficiency are assessed in
        upper secondary school. Teachers point out any weaknesses with a <br>sense
        of tact, highlighting opportunities for overcoming them. <br> <br>Students’
        knowledge and skills are assessed based on their oral answers (presentations)
        and written <br>and/or practical work and practical activities by considering
        the concordance of their knowledge and skills <br>with the learning outcomes
        of the subject syllabus. <br>In providing feedback (incl. on language learning
        outcomes), teacher’s assessments are used alongside <br>with self-assessment
        by students and peer assessment, which are used as the basis of proposals
        for <br>further supportive activities. Students are guided to recognise their
        accomplishments and to use the <br>achievements in further studies, to set
        their own goals for learning and to assess their knowledge and skills <br>in
        the foreign language being studied. <br>Detailed assessment procedures are
        specified in the school curriculum.

        label: 'One of the essential aims of teaching Estonian is to develop a command
          of the language which allows <br>students to cope independently in Estonian
          society and provides a solid foundation for lifelong learning.  In <br>accordance
          with the Development Strategy of the Estonian Language, the curriculum sets
          the goal of <br>reaching the C1 language proficiency level by the end of
          upper secondary school. <br>Teaching Estonian supports students’ ability
          to study other subjects in Estonian. <br>The general theme in upper secondary
          school is ‘Me and the World’. The five thematic areas and their sub-<br>themes
          are intertwined in everyday life and can also be dealt with in teaching
          languages. Through different <br>themes, students can compare the cultural
          spaces of Estonia and their country of origin. In dealing with the <br>themes,
          their topicality, students’ interest and the language level of the course
          are to be taken into account. <br>In building cultural awareness, students’
          attention is drawn to communication differences in their native <br>language
          and Estonian and to cultural manifestations explaining these differences.
          Students are aware of <br>their place in and their responsibility towards
          society and are able to adequately judge social customs and <br>conventions.
          <br>Language lessons in upper secondary school are carried out in Estonian.
          Instruction follows the principles <br>of communicative language learning.
          The emphasis is on interactive learning and practising the language <br>studied.
          Pair and group work are continuously implemented, and the formation of communication
          and <br>presentation skills in Estonian is supported through debates, reviews,
          research, computer-aided <br>presentations, communication portals, blogs,
          etc. By using different activities, teachers provide students <br>with the
          possibility to actively use Estonian outside of classes as well. Students’
          independence in seeking <br>and using information in Estonian increases.
          <br>9 <br> <br>Knowledge of the language is not an aim in its own right,
          but a means for achieving better command of the <br>language. The structure
          of the language is studied in context. As before, the development of learning
          skills <br>which facilitate further language studies and lifelong learning

            tasks which enable them to apply their communication skills by <br>using
            different language registers (e.g. communication with administrative agencies,
            job interviews and in <br>the everyday sphere). <br>Teachers guide students
            to compare and analyse the similarities and differences of languages,
