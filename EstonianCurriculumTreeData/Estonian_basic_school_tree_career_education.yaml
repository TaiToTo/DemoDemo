        to gain better employment on <br>the labour market, increasing their independent
        decision-making, helping to fulfil different roles during their <br>life and
        achieving lifelong learning. Also, ‘Career Education’ enables the employment
        of the human <br>resources in society in the best possible way, joining the
        skills and interests of people with their working <br>and educational potential.
        <br> <br>The subject consists of three parts: <br>1. Self-perception helps
        to develop individual and social skills. The students get to know themselves.
        <br>Their communication and learning skills develop. Understanding and skills
        learnt through this <br>subject will help to prevent drop-outs. <br>2. Knowing
        educational possibilities and working life facilitates the making of aware
        decisions after <br>graduating from basic education. The students notice changes
        on the labour market and they value <br>lifelong learning. <br>3. Planning
        and decision-making. The students develop planning skills and awareness in
        decision-<br>making. They build up an ability to use career information materials.
        The students feel a <br>responsibility in designing their career and coping
        with life. <br> <br>2 <br> <br>‘Career Education’ focuses on developing students’
        awareness of their personality traits and connects <br>these with their career
        choices. The students learn to appreciate lifelong learning; they obtain information
        <br>about the possibilities of further education, and the knowledge to use
        this information in realizing their <br>plans. The students are told about
        different possibilities of work practice, and they are encouraged to try <br>them.
        The ‘Career Education’ curriculum for basic schools consists of one 35-hour
        course. It supports the <br>students in their career planning, and makes them
        ready for lifelong learning, integrating it with the skills <br>and knowledge
        acquired from other subjects.'

        stipulations in the general part of the <br>Basic School National Curriculum
        and other legislation concerning assessment. Knowledge and practical <br>implementation
        skills are evaluated on the basis of students’ general ability to give oral
        answers <br>(presentations), written and/or practical work and practical activities,
        also considering the correspondence <br>of students’ knowledge and skills
        to the aims set in the curriculum. Evaluation is given as a verbal rating
        <br>and as a numerical rating. <br>During ‘Career Education’, no evaluation
        is given of the attitudes and values of the student, but if possible <br>and
        necessary, some feedback is given. In the evaluation process, the personality
        of the student is <br>considered important and its development is supported.
        The student must be an active partner in the <br>evaluation process, because
        this supports the development of their self-analysis skills. <br>It is advisory
        that during this course the students compile their personal learning folder
        where all of the <br>material on self-analysis (as well as the worksheets
        of visiting enterprises and other results of learning <br>tasks and other
        materials of interest concerning the occupation or specialty of interest)
        is collected. The <br>learning task results collected may be personal tasks
        or group work. Presenting such a folder may be used <br>as the final rating
        for the course. <br> <br>At the beginning of the course, the student is told
        what will be evaluated, and when and how it will take <br>place. <br>The following
        items are used for assessment: <br>1) Practical work: compiling a CV; writing
        an essay; review or summary of visits to enterprises or <br>participating
        in work shadow day; personal career plan (study plan), etc.; <br>2) Skills
        in interpreting practical activities; <br>3) Skills in searching for and analysing
        relevant information; <br>4) Creativity and rationality; <br>5) Awareness

        of the curriculum; this is demonstrated by the student in the form of <br>discussions,
        group work folders, etc.'
