      label: 'Social studies subjects address the way in which individuals and society
        functioned in the past and how they <br>function today. Through social studies
        subjects, students develop their ability to see causal and other <br>connections
        in the development of society; to make informed choices by espousing values
        and moral norms <br>valid in society.  Studies shape the students’ willingness
        to act as moral and responsible individuals and <br>members of society. <br>In
        History lessons, students acquire knowledge of the history and cultural heritage
        of their home area and the <br>world necessary for an understanding of their
        cultural space. Through the subject, students are guided to <br>understand,
        analyse, critically judge and interpret historical events and processes as
        well as their mutual <br>relations and links with the present day and to see
        why historical events are interpreted in different ways. <br>Teaching History
        contributes to integrating the content of other subjects into a whole and
        shapes the ability to <br>understand developments which have been influenced
        by past events. <br>Personal, social and health education integrates the learning
        content at all stages of study by supporting <br>students in managing social
        life among their contemporaries, within their family, community and society
        and by <br>helping them to become socially mature and legally capable individuals.
        The general aim of Personal, social <br>and health education is to contribute
        to the development of students’ coping skills in social life. This aim is
        <br>realized by nurturing students as developed personalities and by fostering
        their social competence, health <br>awareness and integrity, regard for others,
        responsibility and fairness. Personal, social and health education <br>helps
        to acquire basic knowledge and attitudes regarding gender equality. <br>In
        Civics and citizenship education, students master social literacy: the knowledge,
        skills, values and <br>attitudes necessary for fully functioning in society
        and for making responsible decisions. The general aim of the <br>subject is
        to create the preconditions for stronger cohesion between individual identity
        as a citizen and society <br>and for creating active citizens. <br>All subjects
        in the social studies subjects field support the development of students’
        ability to analyse their <br>behaviour and its consequences, to express their
        feelings appropriately, to accept that people are different and <br>take this
        into account in communication; to assert themselves and to oppose injustice
        in a way that does not <br>harm their own or other people’s interests or needs.
        Through the subjects within the social studies subject <br>field, students
        become familiar with social values, norms and rules and learn to follow them;
        and they acquire <br>knowledge, skills and attitudes appropriate to socially
        acceptable behaviour and relationships between people <br>which help them
        effectively adjust and function among their contemporaries, in their family,
        community and <br>society. Social studies subjects provide the basis for accepting
        ideological diversity and for willingness to have <br>a dialogue with supporters
        of different worldviews. Cooperation skills and group work are essential in
        the <br>context of every subject within the field. <br> <br> <br>The aim of
        integration within the field is to support students’ development into wholesome
        individuals who <br>have a positive attitude towards themselves and others,
        consider other human beings, act in accordance with <br>general human values,
        and are able to recognise and understand processes in society. They have efficient
        <br>skills and preparation for getting involved and participating in social
        life. <br>The subject teacher selects the learning content with the aim to
        ensure achievement of learning outcomes, <br>general and subject field competences
        as specified for respective stages of study.'

      label: The study of subjects in the field of social studies contributes to the
        development of all general competences <br>described in the national curriculum.
        The teacher plays a crucial role in shaping the four interconnected <br>components
        of competences – knowledge, skills, values and behaviour – with the teacher’s
        values, <br>communication and social skills creating a suitable learning environment
        and influencing students’ values and <br>behaviour. <br>Cultural and value
        competence. The development of cultural and value competence is supported
        by all <br>subjects within the subject field by emphasizing different aspects.
        For instance, the ability to understand the <br>basic values of humanitarianism,
        democracy and sustainable development of society and to base one’s <br>actions
        upon these values is supported through History and Civics and citizenship
        education. All social <br>subjects facilitate respect for different beliefs
        in understanding the world. Personal, social and health education <br>and
        Religious studies support the understanding of value systems, the capacity
        to live in harmony with one’s <br>ideas, words and feelings, having reasons
        for personal choices and having regard for the welfare of others. <br>Skill
        to stand against violations of central norms and to follow the principles
        of social justice and equal <br>treatment of different genders is one of the
        general objectives of the curriculum, and it is developed primarily <br>through
        civics and citizenship education and personal, social and health education.  <br>Self-awareness
        competence that is the ability to understand and assess oneself, to analyse
        one’s strengths <br>and weaknesses and develop a positive attitude towards
        oneself and others; to lead a healthy way of life and <br>effectively and
        safely; to solve problems related to one’s mental, physical and social health
        or personal <br>relationships. The development of competence is supported
        by Personal, social and health education, but also <br>by other subjects within
        the field, which shape ethnic, cultural and national self-management. <br>Learning
        to learn competence. Each subject within the social studies subject field
        develops the ability to <br>organize the learning environment and acquire
        tools and information necessary for studying. Each subject also <br>teaches  students
        how to plan studies and use the knowledge acquired in different contexts and
        in solving <br>problems. Through study activities and receiving feedback,
        students acquire skills of self-analysis and are able <br>to plan their further
        studies accordingly. <br>Communication competence. All subjects address the
        ability to express oneself clearly and appropriately in <br>different situations,
        to read and understand informative and consumer texts as well as fiction,
        to write different <br>types of texts by using appropriate linguistic tools
        and styles and to value correct grammar and expressive <br>language. <br>Mathematics
        and natural sciences and technology competence. Each subject within the social
        studies <br>subject field develops the ability to use mathematics with its
        unique language, symbols and methods to solve <br>different tasks in all spheres
        of life and activity, is supported by all subjects within the field. Students
        learn to <br>distinguish social studies from natural sciences (incl. understand
        the differences between their research <br>methods). They learn to search
        for information using technological tools and to make evidence based <br>decisions
        using collected information. <br>Entrepreneurial competence. Competence in
        entrepreneurship is first and foremost shaped through Civics <br>and citizenship
        education, but also to a lesser extent by other subjects within the field.
        Students learn to <br>observe problems and to see the opportunities they offer,
        to set goals and to generate and implement ideas. <br>Subject studies develop
        the ability to take initiative and responsibility, to cooperate in order to
        accomplish their <br>goals, to complete what they have started, to respond
        to changes in a flexible way, to take reasonable risks <br> <br>and to manage
        uncertainty; and they learn to choose suitable and creative methods for implementing
        their <br>ideas, which result from adequately analysing the situation, their
        abilities and resources and estimating the <br>consequences of their actions
        in line with their goals.

        for students in future employment. Students receive an overview of common
        occupations, professions <br>and further education opportunities associated
        with the social field. Studies help to develop an understanding <br>of causes
        and consequences of changes in society, as well as their impact on students’
        choices and decisions <br>about the future. <br>Various educational activities
        provide students with an overview of the general situation and future prospects
        <br>of the labour market, labour law, different jobs associated with occupations
        and professions of different <br> <br>activities, helping to use this information
        for future educational specialisation and long-term career planning. <br>Various
        occupations and professions are presented with an emphasis on the nature of
        work, the working <br>environment, working conditions and required knowledge,
        skills and character traits. <br>Education provides students with knowledge

        shaping a positive self-concept and <br>an adequate self-assessment. The subject
        syllabus describes learning outcomes of a subject by study stages <br>at two
        levels: general learning outcomes as objectives of education and learning
        outcomes associated with <br>partial skills. Students’ knowledge and skills
        are assessed on the basis of oral response, incl. presentations, <br>and written
        projects, taking into account the conformity of knowledge and skills with
        the required learning <br>outcomes specified in subject syllabi as well as
        students’ individual traits and thought development. <br>Assessment is based
        on corresponding provisions of the general part of the basic school curriculum.
        <br>Feedback is provided on attitudes and values (e.g., showing interest,
        understanding importance, valuing, <br>consideration of needs, following rules).
        <br>Learning outcomes are assessed with verbal assessments and numerical grades.
        Diverse forms of <br>assessment should be used for measuring learning outcomes.
        Students have to be informed about what and <br>when is going to be assessed,

        focuses first and foremost on their content. Students’ grammar and <br>spelling
        mistakes are also corrected, although they are not taken into account in grading.
        The main emphasis <br>when assessing subject-specific knowledge and skills
        and attitudes is on formative assessment.  <br>Diverse forms of assessment,
        including oral, written and practical assignments corresponding to required
        <br>learning outcomes are used for assessment.  <br>Selection of assessment
        methods is made in consideration of students’ age-specific differences, individual
        <br>abilities and preparedness to handle specific activities. The process
        is assessed in addition to the result in <br>case of practical assignments.  <br>In
        spoken and written assignments, students: <br>1) explain and describe the
        meaning of concepts and the relations between them; <br>2) explain their viewpoints,
        assessments, positions and attitudes by relating them to the knowledge they
        <br>have acquired; <br> <br>3) identify, classify, compare and analyse circumstances,
        conditions, activities and characteristics based <br>on learning outcomes;
        and <br>4) demonstrate their familiarity with facts, ideas and norms based
        on the content of assignments. <br> <br>In practical assignments, students:
        <br>1) apply theoretical knowledge in practical learning situations; <br>2)
        demonstrate the skills defined in the learning outcomes in learning situations;
        and <br>3) describe how the knowledge and skills defined in the learning outcomes
        are used in everyday life. <br>Assessment in personal, social and health education
        means supporting achievement of learning outcomes <br>and students’ development,
        with the main emphasis being on supporting students’ development, which should
        <br>include opportunities for self-assessment. In addition to subject-specific
        knowledge and skills, formative <br>feedback is also provided in values and
        attitudes. Assessment of values and attitudes is facilitated by role <br>plays,
        case studies and group work.  <br>The objective of testing and assessing learning
        outcomes in history is to receive an overview of the level of <br>attainment
        of learning outcomes in history studies and individual development of students,
        and to use this <br>information for more productive planning of studies. A
        balance of knowledge (historical vocabulary) and skills <br>should be observed
        when testing learning outcomes. <br>The forms of checking and assessing learning
        outcomes should be diverse and include spoken and written <br>answers, working
        with maps, reference sources and pictures as well as creative tasks and writing
        a story. <br>Tasks that require an analysis of important historical events
        and phenomena should be preferred to knowing <br>specific facts. Short stories
        and descriptions are assessed based on their logical composition and coherence
        <br>and the appropriateness of terms and keywords to the context, style, grammar
        and spelling.  As in Form 5 the <br>tests should not check the knowledge of
        more than one studied theme at a time. <br>The forms of checking and assessing
        learning outcomes in the 3rd stage of study should be diverse and <br>include
        spoken and written answers, working with maps, documents, reference sources
        and pictures, <br>compiling reviews and research papers as well as creative
        tasks and writing discursive essays. In the case of <br>analysing reference
        sources, students’ skills in finding essential information and in judging
        and comparing it, <br>answering based on a text fragment; commenting and deciding
        on its reliability are assessed. Tasks that <br>require analysis of important
        historical events and phenomena should be preferred to knowing specific facts.
        In <br>the case of discursive essays, students are assessed based on the relevance
        of their train of thought to the <br>theme, their familiarity with the relevant
        period and facts, their abilities to compare and find links and to <br>express
        their personal position through well-founded judgements. At the third stage
        of study, both open and <br>multiple choice questions can be used to check
        and assess students’ knowledge. <br>In civics and citizenship education, creation
        of assignments for developing and testing reasoning skills in <br>the 2nd
        study level, from keywords to supportive explanations and exact instructions,
        should be in keeping with <br>the principle of aptitude-appropriateness. Summarising
        grading can be used for opinion essays and case <br>studies, document and
        map knowledge, assignments with open-ended and multiple choice answers, matching
        <br>concepts and definitions, translation of information to a different format
        (from graph to table, etc.), and finding, <br>using and grouping information.  <br>Summative
        assessment in the 3rd stage of study can be based on discussing problems,
        opinion pieces, <br>research papers and case studies, analysing documents,
        statistics and caricatures, reading maps, open and <br>multiple choice tasks:
        linking terms to their explanations, translating information to another form
        (for example, <br>from a diagram to a table), and grouping information. <br>In
        the case of practical work, assessment focuses on the skills of planning and
        performing the work, <br>interpreting its results and drawing conclusions
        as well as explaining and presenting the results. <br>Students and teacher
        cooperate to assess learning outcomes also in informal education outside school
        if the <br>respective attainment (e.g., participation in projects, work in
        student bodies or civic associations) conforms to <br>required learning outcomes.'

          <br> <br> <br>2.1.2 Description of the subject <br> <br>The general objective
          of personal, social and health education is to contribute to the development
          of <br> <br>necessary skills for managing social relations through wholesome
          personal development, social competence, <br>health awareness and general
          human values. <br>Personal, social and health education addresses the knowledge,
          skills and attitudes that contribute to the <br>development of students’
          personalities in a way appropriate to their age. Value education and the
          formation of <br>attitudes is carried out in a thoughtful and supportive
          study environment and focuses on nurturing  students’ <br>positive thinking
          with a view to fostering their ability to function as mature personalities
          coping opportunities. <br>Favourable Civics and citizenship education environments
          are first and foremost based on respecting <br>students’ individuality and
          opinions, on providing opportunities for the free exchange of ideas, for
          taking the <br>initiative and participating and acting alone or with others.
          <br> <br>Study activities at the three stages of study in basic schools
          evolve from the simple to the more complex, but <br>should be understandable
          and meaningful to students in line with subject goals and help them understand
          that <br>the material is useful to them. Personal, social and health education
          is a concentric subject. Its key themes are <br>addressed at every stage
          of study in line with a developmental approach that has regard to (1) forming
          a <br>positive attitude towards oneself and the holistic self and (2) developmental
          tasks and performing them. <br> <br>At the first stage of study, Personal,
          social and health education focuses on students’ reflexive competence <br>and
          their relationships with their close surroundings by integrating the themes
          of Civics and citizenship <br>education. At the second stage of study, teaching
          focuses on students’ social competence and the prevention <br>of social
          problems as well as on a way of life which values and strengthens students’
          health. The third stage of <br>study concentrates on students’ age-specific
          features (puberty) and managing developmental tasks as well as <br>an integrated
          approach to health and social skills. <br> <br>The topics of personal, social
          and health education can be discussed in sequence or in an integrated manner
          <br>to achieve the required learning outcomes based on skills, knowledge
          and values. The contents of learning <br>should be presented as closely
          related to real life as possible, with active study methods constituting
          an <br>important part of education.'

        the subject <br> <br>In History lessons, students acquire the knowledge and
        skills needed to understand their cultural space and <br>historical setting.
        Students are guided to understand, analyse, critically judge and interpret
        historical events <br>and processes, their connections and their links to
        the present day, as well as the reasons why historical <br>events are interpreted
        in different ways. <br> <br>History instruction in basic school is chronological/thematic.
        The subject starts with the basics and continues <br>with studies of remote
        antiquity and antiquity, the Middle Ages, modern history and contemporary
        history. <br>Estonian history is taught in the context of world history. The
        themes concerning Estonian history, which are <br>presented separately in
        the subject syllabus, are examined systematically and in detail and compared
        with the <br> <br> <br>22 <br>history of the world. Teaching is based on moving
        from near to far by beginning with local history, where it is <br>essential
        to establish personal contact with the themes and places being studied. <br>
        <br>History teaching has chronological, political, economic, social, cultural
        and ideological dimensions. In basic <br>school, it is important to ensure
        that the approach to history can be accomplished by students and is person-<br>centred;
        it focuses mainly on the mode of living and culture and less on other dimensions.
        It is not intended <br>that the selected themes through which world history
        is examined should give a complete picture of historical <br>periods. It is
        essential to connect historical events and the phenomena of the past and the
        present and to <br>create an understanding that without understanding the
        past it is very difficult to understand the present, for <br>instance why
        crises occur and what different problems feature in Estonian history. <br>
        <br>Students’ worldviews are enhanced by cross-subject integration and examining
        close themes integrally and <br>from different perspectives. <br> <br>History
        teaching develops different skills and abilities: <br>1) the ability to orient
        in time and to analyse the formation of historical settings; <br>2) understanding
        historical notions and terms and using them in context; <br>3) asking questions
        on history and answering them; <br>4) functional literacy, critical thinking,
        discussion and reasoning skills, creating links and formulating and <br>explaining
        one’s position; <br>5) empathy, the ability to put oneself in the position
        of people who lived in a certain era, cooperation and <br>conflict-resolution
        skills; and <br>6) analysing sources and working with historical maps, finding
        and using information from different <br>sources and assessing it, oral and
        written self-expression and using ICT tools. <br> <br>The formation of skills
        in history teaching is a continuous process which is realized through different
        themes <br>and teaching methods. The level of skill attainment is described
        for each study level as the objectives of <br>history education. <br>It is
        essential to introduce students to different historical approaches in History
        lessons without imposing any of <br>them. In order to understand that the
        writing of history depends on the time and the position of historians, <br>students
        need to be taught to take a critical attitude to different ways of thinking
        and it is important to compare <br>approaches to historical events and phenomena
        from different sources. <br> <br>It is essential to apply versatile methods
        in study activities which enable the students actively  to participate in
        <br>the learning process, develop their skills, draw conclusions and form
        and express their opinions on historical <br>events or phenomena. By analysing
        historical problems, students enhance their value system and historical <br>awareness,
        develop national and cultural identity, tolerance, a positive attitude towards
        democratic values and <br>cultivate their historical thinking.'

        <br> <br>2.3.2 Description of the subject <br> <br>Civics and citizenship
        education plays an important role in the formation of students’ social competence.
        Civics <br>and citizenship education helps students develop into entrepreneurship
        and self-realizing people who have <br>high regard for others and who are
        socially competent members of society. <br> <br>The knowledge, skills and
        attitudes acquired in Civics and citizenship education lessons are closely
        related to <br>the content learned in other subjects (such as History, Geography,
        Personal, social and health education) and <br>provide the basis for lifelong
        learning. <br> <br> <br> <br>30 <br>Civics and citizenship education in basic
        school examines in a general manner the functioning of society, <br>citizens’
        involvement in the main social spheres (economy, politics and law) and also
        relations with other social <br>groups. Citizens are seen as members of a
        democratic society who interact with social institutions based on <br>their
        interests and opportunities. <br> <br>Civics and citizenship education plays
        an important role in shaping students’ values and attitudes, such as <br>initiative,
        law compliance, diligence, gender equality, civic initiative, social justice
        and equal treatment of <br>citizens, respect for human rights, understanding
        of differences, disapproval of prejudice, sustainable attitude <br>towards
        the environment, respect for cultural traditions of other nations and countries
        and desire to learn more <br>about to them, valuing the cultural heritage
        of one’s own country; realisation that people do not live equally well <br>everywhere,
        etc. <br>Personal, social and health education aims to give the students an
        integral picture of the functioning of society <br>by means of practical assignments,
        analysing problems and learning basic subject-related terms. Solving <br>problems
        of everyday life and acquiring skills in making informed decisions, which
        contribute to students’ <br>ability to manage in society, are also very important.
        Thus, students develop an integrated picture of society <br>which acknowledges
        the reciprocal impact of human activity and nature and which values a sustainable
        way of <br>life. <br>At the 1st stage of study, the themes related to Civics
        and citizenship education are integrated into the subject <br>syllabus of
        Personal, social and health education. At the 2nd and 3rd stages of study,
        Civics and citizenship <br>education is taught as a separate subject. At the
        2nd stage of study, students examine the system of social <br>relations in
        their immediate surroundings by concentrating on the coexistence of socially
        different individuals <br>and groups. They focus on the people around them,
        their school and people at home. <br> <br>At the 3rd stage of study, the students
        also examine the institutions related to the functioning of the Estonian <br>state.
        In studying the execution of public governance, such constitutional institutions.
        As some students may <br>not continue their education after basic school,
        more attention is paid to the manifestation of politics in <br>everyday life
        and citizens’ roles as knowledgeable consumers of policy output. <br> <br>Economic
        issues dealt with at the 3rd stage of study focus on personal management,
        business, the regulation <br>of the national economy and social impact of
        the market economy (consumer society, balance on the labour <br>market and
        economic stratification). The subject is integrated with everyday life as
        much as possible. <br>Research-based learning techniques are very important
        in teaching. These techniques support students in <br>acquiring the skills
        of posing problems, formulating hypotheses, planning and organizing their
        work, critical <br>thinking and interpreting and presenting results, both
        in speech and in writing by using varied visual means <br>and using situations
        from real life wherever appropriate (for example via democracy in school,
        civic initiative <br>and volunteering in the home area). <br> <br>The concept
        of active citizens covers their involvement in a broader context, not only
        in the sense of casting <br>their vote during elections. Moreover, it gives
        students who cannot as yet exercise their right to vote better <br>opportunities
        to implement Civics and citizenship education in practice (for example, in
        organizing school life, <br>consumer education, civic initiatives). <br> <br>Throughout
        the studies, modern technological means (including ICT) are used by considering
        the legitimacy of <br>software, the security risks of the Internet and IT
        and cyber crimes (the State Portal, e-services, websites of <br>local and
        national authorities, information queries and online legal acts).'
