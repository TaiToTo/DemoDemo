        on the formation of social, ethical and aesthetic value judgements and <br>support
        an open and critical attitude towards different cultural phenomena. Art subjects
        presume and <br>ensure that students participate actively in artistic activities,
        as this helps develop their thinking as well as <br>their emotional world,
        perception, creativity and analytical skills. By relying on knowledge and
        skills, <br>students use their creative abilities and reflect on their own
        role and the role of art in society. <br> <br>The content, activities and

      label: The subject field enables development of all general competences in daily
        education through theoretical <br>studies and practical activities. The teacher
        plays a crucial role in shaping the four interconnected <br>components of
        competences – knowledge, skills, values and behaviour – with the teacher’s
        values and <br>self-assertion skills creating a suitable learning environment
        and influencing students’ values and <br>behaviour. Cooperation between school
        and home is important for the development of general <br>competences. <br>Cultural
        and value competence. The subjects in the field of arts emphasise cultural
        knowledge and a <br>cultural sphere based on shared cultural heritage as a
        part of learner’s identity. Activities promote original <br>creative solutions
        as well as cultural and social diversity. Development of ethical and aesthetic
        values is <br>supported through discussion topics and analysis of art works
        and events. Practical creative efforts and <br>reflection on them teach students
        to acknowledge art and music as means of self-expression, to appreciate <br>3
        <br> <br>different ideas, opinions and solutions to problems, and to respect
        authorship. Education promotes <br>conscious and critical attitude towards
        different information channels. <br>Social and citizenship competence. Research
        and practical group assignments, creative assignments, <br>discussions and
        presentations, collective musical performances and participation in field-specific
        and inter-<br>field study projects in art subjects develop students’ readiness
        for cooperation and high regard for mutual <br>support. Participation in cultural
        events helps to promote a sense of cultural unity. Reflection on art works
        <br>facilitates the habit of justifying one’s positions and respecting the
        opinions of others. Art subjects help <br>students to acknowledge the impact
        of human beings and shapers and users of the environment, guiding <br>them
        towards informed and sustainable behaviour in nature and in artificial spatial
        and virtual <br>environments. <br>Self-awareness competence. Continuous feedback
        and self-analysis associated with creative <br>assignments help students to
        improve their awareness of their own interests and abilities and to establish
        <br>positive self-esteem. Discussion of cultural and social topics (observed
        cultural phenomena, subject-matter <br>and messages of art works and musical
        compositions, etc.) contributes to the development of personal, <br>social
        and cultural identity. The aim is to integrate young people in modern society
        and to support the <br>development of their identity through creativity.  <br>
        <br>Learning to learn competence. Art subjects facilitate the development
        of learning to learn competence <br>through the application of diverse assignments,
        study methods and forms of work, which enable students to <br>identify and
        use their personal learning styles. Individual and group research and problem
        assignments <br>require collection, analysis and interpretation of information
        and the application of acquired knowledge in <br>novel situations. In art
        subjects, students are given accomplishable assignments to create, to check
        the <br>suitability of their choices, to test new skills and to practice on
        a consistent basis. Continuous feedback and <br>self-analysis help to increase
        students’ role in managing their own education.  <br>Communication competence.
        An important element of art subjects is discussion of different art works,
        <br>styles, periods, etc., using both correct native language and subject-specific
        terminology in the descriptions. <br>Presentation of own creations and comparison
        and justification of different opinions in discussions support <br>the development
        of articulacy and the use of subject-specific terminology. Preparation of
        summaries and <br>creative projects in arts and music requires an understanding
        of reference texts and ability to use different <br>methods of information
        presentation (text. drawing, scheme, table, chart, etc.). Art subjects present
        art and <br>music as means of communication, describing their unique non-verbal
        language and ‘translating’ messages <br>from one language to another.  <br>Mathematics,
        natural sciences and technology competence. Completion of assignments in art
        subjects <br>requires formulation of problems, reflection on solution ideas,
        justification of options and analysis of results. <br>Students learn to analyse
        art categories (composition, structure, rhythm, etc.), compare and classify
        the <br>attributes of different art phenomena and use symbols. Art subjects
        enable students to practice the use of <br>technological tools in creative
        assignments. Through creative activities, students learn how to use novel
        <br>solutions and understand the role of science and technology in the development
        of music and art, <br>Entrepreneurial competence can be developed in art subjects
        through individual and group work, <br>research and problem assignments, and
        linking the content of learning with everyday phenomena. Art <br>subjects
        are characterised by appreciation of novel and creative solutions. Practical
        creative activities <br>enable students to test different options of expressing
        and presenting ideas by identifying suitable methods <br>in a resourceful
        manner and emphasising one’s strengths. Students learn to plan their activities
        and to take <br>4 <br> <br>responsibility for completion and results of their
        projects. They also learn about professions and institutions <br>associated
        with the field.

        skill of creating associations and logical reasoning (mathematical <br>language,
        structure, symbols and methods). <br>Natural science. Education creates awareness
        of the physiological characteristics of human senses of <br>hearing and sight,
        provides information on the natural environment and the diversity of its organisms,

        Students examine relations with other human beings and groups of people, as
        well as with <br>customs and traditions of different cultures, the roles and
        changes of art and culture in different historical <br>periods. They learn
        about ethical and aesthetic beliefs of different time periods and their connections
        with <br>social, economic, ideological, technological, etc., influences. The
        shared elements include <br>acknowledgement and appreciation of the cultural
        diversity of the world and the development of skills to <br>express and justify
        personal opinions.  <br>Physical education. Education develops bodily sensibility,
        motor skills, reaction speed and coordination. <br>Many concepts overlap with
        the concepts of art subjects (movement, dynamics, rhythm, etc.).

        assessment – supporting learning and development – is primarily used in art
        subjects. <br>The goal of assessment is to provide students with encouraging
        feedback on their individual development, <br>to improve self-analysis skills,
        guide the development of self-esteem, and support identification and <br>development
        of a personal visual/musical style.  <br>The items observed are both the process

        and completed work, visual self-expression skills and participation in discussions,
        analysis of a work <br>of art, research work etc.). In music, they include

        always know what will be assessed and what the assessment criteria and basis
        of <br>assessment are. In selecting the form of tasks and defining the aspects
        of assessment, it is essential to <br>attach value to the students’ ability
        to find and interpret relevant information and draw conclusions. The <br>assessment
        of written assignments focuses first and foremost on their content, but students’
        orthography <br>mistakes are also corrected, although not taken into account
        in grading. <br>In summarising grading, students’ knowledge and skills are

          following constituent skills in students: <br>1) making  music (singing
          and playing an instrument); <br>2) composing; and <br>3) listening to music
          and music history.  <br> <br>Instruction in upper secondary schools focuses
          on developing individual skills and proficiency, enhancing <br>subjective
          thinking and implementing students’ social skills in musical activities
          by using versatile study <br>forms and teaching methods. In lessons, students
          sing pieces for one and several voices (joint singing) and <br>in school
          choirs for three or four voices. Skills in making music (rhythm and barred
          instruments, recorder, <br>mini-harp and acoustic guitar) learned in basic
          school are implemented and students are offered different <br>possibilities
          to make music both individually and in different instrumental groups. In
          composing music, <br>students are encouraged to use both traditional and
          multimedia means to implement their creative ideas.  <br>By listening to
          music, students concentrate on expressing their opinions and explaining
          them in a well-<br>grounded manner both orally and in writing by relying
          on their knowledge and using musical terminology. <br>Music history provides
          information on the forms of expression, styles, composers and performers
          of <br>different time periods and creates associations between the past
          and the present. Students’ individual <br>performance skills and initiative
          are developed both in music lessons and extracurricular activities (choirs,
          <br>soloists and different instrumental groups). <br>Cooperation with a
          local music school is advisable for increased concert activity. Visits of
          concerts and <br>theatre performances, as well as to locations with musical
          significance (museums, studios, higher <br>education institutions, etc.),
          combined if possible with the topics of the course, increase students’ <br>knowledge
          and expand their horizons. Based on the subject syllabus, students are involved
          in the planning <br>of learning contents with their suggestions and choices.   <br>2.1.3

        label: 'Art education in upper secondary schools aims to support the formation
          of students’ integral worldview in <br>which exploring art history and the
          contemporary visual environment play a big part. The development of <br>art
          is addressed in a broader context by creating links with culture, society
          and history. The formation of a <br>positive attitude towards art is facilitated.
          <br> <br>Art education in upper secondary school lays the foundation for
          an understanding of the forms and visual <br>language of art and visual
          culture and valuing the diversity of cultures by explaining general terms
          and <br>concepts. Teaching focuses mainly on comparing the manners of depiction
          in different periods and creating <br>description models. Art history unfolds
          through larger groups of themes; examples of earlier art are <br>compared
          to 20th and 21st century art. The theme-based approach makes it possible
          to emphasise the <br>connections between art and developments in society
          and culture. It is important to demonstrate the <br>interconnectivity between
          the art and the general way of thinking of the same era, and to point out
          the <br>social factors which led to changes in culture and way of living:
          the impact of philosophy, religion and <br>regimes and the development of
          technology and the economy. The theme-based approach helps students <br>find
          their way among abundant artistic movements, develops their concentration
          and observation skills and <br>encourages them to find links between the
          past and the present. <br> <br>In exploring contemporary art, design, the
          environment and the virtual media environment, the main focus <br>is on
          analysing context and message. It is essential to interpret art and visual
          culture in the cultural context <br>of the present. When exploring art,
          it essential to point out parallels with local and Estonian art and culture
          <br>at every opportunity and give relevant examples. <br> <br>Artistic creative
          activities offer the students the chance to enjoy making art, but also to
          develop expressive <br>skills and facilitate emotional and personal growth.
          The task of art education is to support the development <br>of students’
          skills of creative thinking, connection-finding and problem-solving. <br>
          <br>13 <br> <br>The learning content is divided into three contingent modules:
          <br>1) KNOW! or content/structural overview (history and nature of art and
          the birth of contemporary art <br>and its development trends); <br>2) THINK!
          or the thematic part which creates links and broadens students’ knowledge
          (cross-curricula  <br>themes in different periods and  comparisons;  <br>3)
          CREATE! or the investigative, practical and confirmative part (field trips
          and creative and research <br>projects). <br> <br>KNOW! themes are covered
          in general both in terms of time and content; the objective is to give students
          a <br>setting to explore and compare the  cross-curricula themes across
          different periods of art history.  <br>THINK! module can be use to establish
          links between recurrent topics of different eras while CREATE! <br>involves
          creative practical assignments, based on the theoretical foundation of lectures
          and research – the <br>balance between them is a matter of teaching methodology.  <br>
          <br>CREATE! helps to reinforce the contents of learning and expand creative
          experiences. The integrated <br>learning process is supported by collection,
          systematisation and analysis of visual materials. <br>The learning contents
          can be selected and activities can be planned by combining the topics of
          two <br>courses, ensuring achievement of required learning outcomes, field-specific
          and general competences.  <br>Due to the particular nature of the arts field
          and different capabilities of schools/teachers to allocate topics <br>between
          courses, the learning outcomes of both courses are presented in a general
          manner as a single <br>unit.  <br> <br>2.2.3 Learning outcomes in upper
