      label: 'The syllabus of the optional course of religious studies consists of
        two 35-hour courses – “People and <br>Religion” and “The Religious Landscape
        of Estonia”.with the option of a more comprehensive course,  <br>which compilation
        must rely on the general goals of the optional course, the principles of teaching
        and the <br>learning activities and outcomes that the upper secondary school
        wishes to achieve. <br> <br>The optional course includes two courses: Course
        I is entitled  <br> <br>The optional course of religious studies is based
        on the principles of freedom of religion and thought and: <br>1) covers different
        religions and religious movements; <br>2) teaches pupils to understand how
        religion is expressed in culture, in our individual lives and in <br>society;
        and <br>3) discusses existential issues. <br> <br>2 <br> <br>The optional
        course of religious studies originates from the principle of recognition of
        freedom of religion <br>and thought in the United Nation’s Universal Declaration
        of Human Rights. Religious education is one of <br>the preconditions for ensuring
        freedom of religion in society. These religious studies do not advertise any
        <br>particular church, congregation or other religious association. The optional
        course of religious studies is not <br>meant to influence pupils to accept
        a particular world view as the norm. The task of religious studies at the
        <br>upper secondary school level is not to guide pupils towards acceptance
        of a particular religion. The goal is <br>to prepare the pupils for life in
        a pluralistic society and in a world where they will come into contact with
        <br>people of different religions and world views. That is why the stress
        in these religious studies is on shaping <br>skills and attitudes that form
        the basis of mutual understanding, respect, openness and readiness for <br>dialogue
        and cooperation. <br> <br>The process of learning about different religions
        and world views must rely on a balanced scientific <br>approach. The pupils
        who attend lessons of religious studies will gradually understand the diverse
        religious <br>heritage and modern-day positive and negative manifestations
        of religions. Religion in all societies has <br>always been one of the forces
        shaping our lives and culture, and a source of inspiration for writers, artists
        <br>and musicians. Religious education facilitates understanding of global
        cultural heritage. <br> <br>The pupils’ empathy and mutual respect are supported
        by examining various ways of comprehending the <br>world around us. Religious
        studies must be organised and conducted so as to take into account and <br>respect
        the convictions that the pupils are exposed to at home. An important component
        of religious studies <br>is the support of the pupils’ moral development through
        the fostering of responsible and ethical life skills. <br> <br>Learning about
        different religions and world views develops critical thinking, creates opportunities
        for <br>tackling existential issues and supports each pupil in shaping their
        own world view. The optional course of <br>religious studies enriches the
        outlook of the pupils as they become familiarised with various ways of <br>comprehending
        the world we live in. The teaching materials used in religious studies are
        connected with <br>the previous knowledge and experience of the pupils. It
        is important to become familiarised with the cultural <br>values of the home
        area and the local religion and to create connections with the problems and
        questions <br>posed by the pupils. It is recommended to involve the pupils
        in the process of compilation of the religious <br>studies work schedule.'

        the content of studies and the expected learning <br>outcomes, with support
        given to integration with other subjects and cross-curricular topics; <br>2)
        the pupils’ workload (including home assignments) should be moderate and evenly
        distributed <br>throughout the school year, leaving them sufficient time to
        rest and pursue their hobbies; <br>3) the pupils can study alone or with others
        (independent and pair or group work) as this supports <br>their development
        as active and independent learners; <br>4) differentiated learning tasks are
        given and their content and difficulty levels support the individual <br>approach
        and enhance motivation to learn; <br>5) modern teaching materials and means
        are used which are based on modern information and <br>communication technologies;
        <br>3 <br> <br>6) the learning environment is expanded: the pupils attend
        shrines of different religions, museums, <br>exhibitions and the computer
        classroom; <br>7) different methods of teaching are used, including active
        learning: role play; conversations; <br>discussions; argumentation; debates;
        defining and solving problems; formulation of questions and <br>personal viewpoints
        and their justification; project work; compilation of learning portfolios
        and <br>research papers; creative methods: drama; artistic and musical self-expression;
        educational <br>excursions, meetings with prominent (preferably local) personalities;
        familiarisation with symbol <br>systems; learning about the primary features
        of the teachings of local religious denominations, their <br>spheres of activity
        and institutions (e.g. monasteries and convents, children and youth work forms,
        <br>social work and protection of heritage); analysis of religious texts;
        and the implementation of <br>scientific methods of religious research. Preparation
        and oral delivery of synopses supports the <br>acquisition of initial research
        work experience and develops public speaking skills. Essay-writing <br>facilitates
        the development of written expression skills;  <br>8) central significance
        is the development of critical thinking and skills of analysing world view
        issues <br>and formulating arguments concerning these issues. All pupils should
        become used to the idea that <br>discussing a problem will often not result
        in its solution but will at least allow the participants to <br>better understand
        it. It is important to acquire the fundamental concepts, classify religions,
        obtain a <br>general overview of the characteristic features of religious
        life in different eras and comprehend the <br>religious diversity in Estonia.'

        that regulates such assessment. Assessed are the pupils’ knowledge, their
        <br>skills in implementing this knowledge and their acquisition of general
        competences on the basis of oral <br>answers (presentations), written and/or
        practical work and practical activities, taking into account how the <br>knowledge

        case studies <br>and group work. In this case assessment covers not only the
        outcome, but also the reasoning and process. <br>The pupil must actively participate
        in the assessment process and their explanations, justifications and self-<br>analysis
        play an important part. Assessment must take into account solution variations

        cope with a particular <br>activity. The learning outcomes are assessed with
        oral appraisal and number grades. <br> <br>The pupils must know what is assessed
        and when, what means are used for assessment and what the <br>assessment criteria
        are.
