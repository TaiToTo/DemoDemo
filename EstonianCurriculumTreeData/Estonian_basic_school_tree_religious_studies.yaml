        world views on the lives of individuals and society, providing <br>examples,
        both positive and problematic. <br> <br>1.2. <br>Subject Description and Content
        distribution <br> <br>The subject of religious studies is based on the principles
        of freedom of religion and thought and: <br>1) covers different religions
        and religious movements; <br>2) teaches the students to understand how religion
        is expressed in culture, in the lives of individuals <br>and in society; and
        <br>3) discusses existential issues. <br> <br>The subject of religious studies
        is based on the recognition of the principle of freedom of religion and <br>thought
        as stipulated in the United Nation’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
        Religious education is <br>one of the preconditions for ensuring freedom of
        religion in society. <br>These religious studies do not advertise any particular
        church, congregation or other religious association. <br>The optional course
        of religious studies is not meant to influence the students to accept a particular
        world <br>view as the norm. The task of the optional course at the basic school
        level is not to guide the students <br>towards acceptance of any particular
        religion. The goal is to prepare the students for life in a pluralistic <br>society
        and in a world where they will come into contact with people of different
        religions and world views. <br>That is why the stress in these religious studies
        is on shaping skills and attitudes that form the basis for <br>mutual understanding,
        respect, openness and readiness for dialogue and cooperation. <br>The process
        of learning about different religions and world views must rely on a balanced
        scientific <br>approach. The students who attend lessons of religious studies
        will gradually understand the diversity of <br>religions in the past as well
        as in contemporary world with its positive and negative manifestations. Religion
        <br>in all societies has always been one of the forces shaping people’s lives
        and culture, and a source of <br>inspiration for writers, artists and musicians.
        Religious education facilitates understanding of global cultural <br>heritage.
        <br>The students’ empathy and mutual respect are encouraged by examining various
        ways of comprehending <br>the world around us. Religious studies must be organised
        and conducted so as to take into account and <br>respect the convictions that
        the students are exposed to at home. An important component of religious <br>studies
        is the support of the students’ moral development through the fostering of
        responsible and ethical <br>life skills. Learning about different religions
        and world views develops critical thinking, creates opportunities <br>for
        tackling existential issues and supports each student in shaping their own
        world view. <br>The subject of religious studies enriches the outlook of the
        students as they become familiarised with <br>various ways of comprehending
        the world we live in. <br>The teaching materials used in religious studies
        are connected with the previous knowledge and <br>experience of the students.
        It is important to become familiarised with the religion related cultural
        values of <br>the home area, and to create connections with the problems and
        questions posed by the students. It is <br>recommended to involve the students
        in the process of compilation of the religious studies work schedule. <br>1st
        Stage of Study: customs, stories and values  <br>2ndStage of Study: values
        and choices  <br>3rd Stage of Study: one world, different religions  <br>
        <br>1.3. <br>Learning activities are planned and conducted in the following
        manner: <br> <br>1) the basis consists of the fundamental values and general
        competences stipulated in the curriculum, <br>the general goals of the subject,
        the content of studies and the expected learning outcomes, with <br>support
        given to integration with other subjects and cross-curriculum dimensions;
        <br>2) the students’ workload (including home assignments) should be moderate
        and evenly distributed <br>throughout the school year, leaving them sufficient
        time to rest and pursue their hobbies; <br>3) the students can study individually
        or with others (independent and pair or group work) as this <br>supports their
        development as active and independent learners; <br>4) differentiated learning
        tasks are given and their content and levels of difficulty support an individual
        <br>approach and enhance motivation to learn; <br>5) modern teaching materials
        and means are used which are based on modern information and <br>communication
        technologies; <br>6) the learning environment is expanded: the students attend
        shrines of different religions, museums, <br>exhibitions and the computer
        classroom; and <br>7) different methods of teaching are used, including active
        learning: role play, discussions, debates, <br>problem-solving, project studies,
        learning portfolio and research paper compilation.'

      label: The learning outcomes of religious studies are assessed in accordance
        with the general part of the national <br>curriculum for basic schools and
        school curriculum. Assessed are the students’ knowledge, their skills in <br>implementing
        this knowledge and their acquisition of general competences on the basis of
        oral answers <br>(presentations), written and/or practical work and practical
        activities, taking into account how the knowledge <br>and skills of the students
        comply with the learning outcomes stipulated in the subject syllabus. Neither
        the <br>attitudes nor the values of the students are assessed. Feedback is
        provided to each student regarding their <br>attitudes and values. Attitudes
        and values can be analysed via role play, case studies and group work. In
        <br>this case not only the outcome is assessed, but also the reasoning. The
        students must actively participate <br>in the assessment process and their
        explanations, justifications and self-analysis play an important part. <br>Assessment
        must take into account solution variations and the individuality of each student.
        Assessment <br>also serves as a means of supporting student development. Assessment
        methods are selected with <br>consideration given to the age of the students,
        their individual abilities and readiness to cope with a <br>particular activity.
        The learning outcomes are assessed using oral appraisal and numerical grades.
        <br>The forms of learning outcome assessment must be versatile and suitable
        for such assessment. <br>The students must know what is being assessed and
        when, what means are being used for assessment <br>and what the assessment
        criteria are.

        selection at the 1st Stage of Study focuses on the child’s personality: supporting
        the development of <br>self-image and creating a feeling of safety and moral
        upbringing. As the range of topics expands, such <br>stories are studied that
        facilitate the shaping of social competence. The doctrines of religions are
        not <br>studied at this school stage. Support must be provided to ensure development
        of the child’s self-cognition <br>with understanding of emotions and skills
        in controlling them. To comprehend cultural continuity and <br>traditions,
        all year round the students learn about the primary festive dates in the folk
        calendar, their <br>religious background and celebratory customs. <br>During
        the lessons the teacher makes sure that the students learn how to express
        themselves, are not <br>afraid to ask questions, learn how to substantiate
        answers, draw conclusions and respect different <br>viewpoints. <br>The learning
        activities are as diverse and interactive as possible. <br>The teaching methods
        used are story-telling and conversations, which helps connect the material
        to the <br>students’ experience, and problem-solving tasks that suit the age
        of the students. The skills of reading, <br>writing and text comprehension
        are developed. Attention is also given to shaping the skills of listening,
        <br>observation and concentration. The lessons also include manual activities,
        movement games, singing and <br>listening to music. <br>Methods that foster
        creativity (for example role play, creative writing, and artistic self-expression)
        are also <br>important. Educational outings are organised to integrate material
        from local studies.'

        us. Solidarity. Richness and <br>poverty. <br>Envy and charity. <br>The power
        of a word: pledges, keeping one’s word, giving assessments, honesty and hypocrisy.
        <br> <br>Learning Activities <br> <br>The central idea is that of implementing
        the principles of active and problem-based learning. To the <br>learning activities
        already used at 1st Stage of Study are added discussions, more attention to
        developing <br>the skills of question-posing, assessment-giving and substantiation.
        Application of narrative methods <br>facilitates values education. Problem-solving
        tasks, roleplay and analysis of moral dilemmas serve to <br>develop the skills
        of problem-noticing, listening, cooperation and consideration for others.
        Teachers who <br>strive to support the moral development of the students must
        exhibit sensitivity, attention and discretion. <br>In topics about ethics
        the students become familiarised with classic virtues: their content is revealed
        in a <br>clear manner so that the students understand them and are inspired
        to develop themselves accordingly. <br>Such teaching cannot be reduced to
        formal moralising. <br>When selecting educational materials for the ethics
        course, the teacher should ensure that they contain: <br>1) stories derived
        from different religious traditions; <br>2) stories about certain people whose
        life and work conformed with important ethical principles and <br>these people
        can thus be presented as role models for the younger generation; and <br>3)
        examples of current movements and organisations that operate in accordance
        with humanist <br>ethical principles and pay attention to and help weaker
        members of society. <br>It would be beneficial if the students, during this
        course, could also participate in planning and organisation <br>of a social
        project.'

        content and the teacher focuses on the main facets of each such religion.
        <br>During the 3rd Stage of Study several new opportunities are added to the
        previously described learning <br>activities suited to older students, such
        as: selective familiarisation with religious basic texts and analysis of <br>distinctive
        features of religious texts, which facilitate comprehension of the peculiarities
        of the religious <br>language and development of understanding of metaphorical
        language. Familiarisation with different <br>religions and world views allows
        the students to acquire the skill of comparing them and seeing connections
        <br>between religion and culture. It is important to shape an open and respectful
        attitude towards different <br>cultures. Project study opportunities, compilation
        of short abstracts, procurement of information from <br>reference sources
        and the Internet and critical assessment of the materials found develop the
        skill of <br>independent thinking. Attention should also be given to development
        of debating skills. It is important for <br>the students to learn how to substantiate
        their viewpoints. Religions are studied at this stage with greater <br>attention
        given to the approach that describes distinctive features: manifestations
        of customs, traditions and <br>religion in our daily lives. It is important
        to introduce religions with their inherent diversity.'
