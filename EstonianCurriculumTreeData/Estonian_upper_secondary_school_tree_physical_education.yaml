      label: 'The purpose of teaching physical education in upper secondary school
        is to develop students’ physical <br>education competence, i.e., ability to
        recognise the value of physical activity and healthy living as a part of <br>one’s
        lifestyle; ability to assess one’s physical fitness level in an objective
        manner and to use suitable <br>means and methods for developing physical abilities;
        practice suitable sports or form exercise; recognise <br>the value of cooperation
        in sports/exercise and of knowledge about Estonian and world sports events.  <br>
        <br>Teaching physical education is aimed at the upper secondary school graduate
        having developed the <br>capability to: <br>1) value life, understand the
        importance of physical activity to people’s health and enjoy <br>/exercising/practising
        sports; <br>2) master knowledge, skills and experience to practise recreational
        sports/exercise independently <br>both indoors and outdoors; <br>3) follow
        regulations and personal safety and hygiene requirements while exercising/practising
        sports <br>and know how to act in emergency situations that may occur while
        practising sports; <br>4) are able to objectively assess their level of physical

        in Estonia and in the world and <br>understand the role of physical culture
        in modern society; and <br>9) know the necessary physical fitness regime for
        service in the Defence Forces. <br> <br>1.2 Subject and number of courses
        <br> <br>Physical education is taught in five compulsory courses and two elective
        courses. Compulsory courses <br>include gymnastics, athletics, games (basketball,
        volleyball and football) of which the school has to select <br>at least two,
        dance movement, navigation and winter sports (skiing and skating) of which
        the school has to <br>select at least one. The elective courses are “Physical
        abilities and exercise skills“ and “Exercising <br>outdoors“. The passing
        of compulsory and elective courses helps to develop the competences of the
        <br>subject field, while also preparing students for the physical readiness
        test of the Defence Forces (this <br>applies in particular to male students,
        supporting their individual development, while female students can <br>opt
        for this on a voluntary basis). <br>2 <br> <br>The volume of presentation
        of different sports in the courses and the number of lessons dedicated to
        <br>particular sports are specified in the school curriculum.'

      label: Physical education supports students in developing a healthy and physically
        active lifestyle. Knowledge, <br>skills and experiences acquired in physical
        education lessons enable students to knowingly use regular <br>exercise/ sports
        to improve their health. Understanding of physical culture as a part of the
        social <br>environment developed at school encourages interest in following
        sports and cultural events and <br>participating therein. The organisation
        of physical education studies supports the individual physical, moral, <br>social
        and aesthetic development of students. <br>Physical education lessons in upper
        secondary school increase and improve the knowledge and skills <br>students
        have acquired in basic school. Specification of learning content and the choice
        of learning <br>methods and forms proceeds from the need to guide students
        to develop a life-long exercising routine and <br>establish preparedness to
        monitor their physical fitness level and an ability to improve it. <br>Knowledge
        regarding exercise/sports and exercising/practising sports, including knowledge
        about sports <br>history, exercise culture, planning of an exercising routine,
        self-control etc, is introduced through practical <br>activities in lessons
        and by guiding students towards independent (extracurricular) learning. <br>Learning
        outcomes and learning content presented in the syllabus of the compulsory
        physical education <br>courses can be achieved within 70-80% of the prescribed
        number of lessons. Dancing activities performed <br>in physical education
        lessons may be integrated with other sports and forms of exercise. Schools
        are <br>allowed to use 20-30% of the prescribed physical education lessons
        to teach sports and/or forms of <br>exercise not included in the syllabus
        (i.e. swimming, other team sports– handball, hockey, baseball, <br>badminton,
        different dance styles etc), to reinforce the skills of the main fields of
        area included in the <br>syllabus and/or to teach the these in a more profound
        manner. The knowledge, acquired in physical <br>education lessons in the course
        of general physical training, on the necessary physical preparation regime
        <br>for service in the Defence Forces and the content of the NATO test provide
        male and female students with <br>a knowledge about the extent of necessary
        development of their physical abilities. General physical <br>training, incl.
        push-ups for 2 minutes, crunches for 2 minutes, and 3,200 m of running, is
        organised on an <br>ongoing basis during education in the subject.  <br>The
        subject teacher selects the learning content with the aim to ensure achievement
        of specified learning <br>outcomes, subject field and general competences.
        The school can increase the variety of physical <br>education, using unallocated
        lesson hours, based on students’ interests, sports and exercise traditions
        of <br>the school and/or locality, and available sports facilities. The schools
        also use the aforementioned options <br>for specifying the content of elective
        courses in addition to the specification in the subject syllabus. <br>Optional
        courses of physical education studies provide students with the opportunity
        to increase their <br>knowledge and skills and to improve their physical abilities.
        The optional course ‘Physical Exercises in the <br>Open Air’ provides students
        with the opportunity to improve their health through hardening one’s body.
        At <br>their own initiative, schools can prepare elective courses on exercise/sports
        to enable students to practice <br>sports and exercise outside of lessons.

        communicating, and also to assert themselves. Joint activities highlight students’
        abilities <br>and develop their skills. This also improves students’ coping
        ability, cooperation skills, empathy, will, self-<br>expression and discipline.

        prevent dangerous situations. <br>Learning to learn competence. Purposeful

        of sports-related technical skills, explication of physical performance <br>ability
        and the dynamics of sports results support development of technological competence.  <br>Entrepreneurial

        process. When evaluating the <br>motor skills presented as learning outcomes,
        both the achieved level and the students’ efforts for acquiring <br>the activity/exercise
        are evaluated. The level of skills is evaluated on the basis of test exercise
        <br>performance. <br>When evaluating physical abilities, teachers consider

        fitness for service in the Defence <br>Forces.  <br>When evaluating students’
        knowledge, students’ ability to implement the acquired knowledge in actual

        (performing physical exercises prescribed by their attending physician, <br>7
        <br> <br>fulfilling the tasks given by the physical education teacher etc.).
        From the learning outcomes specified in <br>the syllabus, acquiring knowledge

        teachers proceed from the health status of the student – evaluating the performance
        of test exercises <br>meant for students with special needs or simplified
        versions of the test exercises, performance of sports <br>techniques etc.
        In case the health status of the student does not enable them to fulfil the
        syllabus of <br>physical education, the teacher compiles an individual study
        programme on the basis of the prescriptions of <br>the student’s attending
