        study stage is specified in the school curriculum, <br>taking into account
        the need to ensure achievement of required learning outcomes and educational
        <br>objectives. <br>The subject teacher selects the contents of education
        for presentation in consideration of achievability of <br>the learning outcomes,
        subject field competences and general competences specified for study levels.
        <br> <br>Craft study deals with the basics of handicraft, home economics and
        technology studies and develops <br>primary constituent skills, field-specific
        and general competencies. <br>At the 2nd stage of study the students are divided
        into study groups based on their wishes and interests, <br>selecting either
        handicraft and home economics or technology studies. The division into study
        groups is not <br>gender-based and the school curriculum can include provisions
        for teaching the subjects of the technology <br>field in combined classes
        at the 2nd and 3rd stages of study to contribute to the promotion of gender
        equality <br>and to provide both boys and girls with necessary knowledge and
        skills in technology studies, handicraft <br>and home economics. <br>The students
        switch between the study groups for at least 10% of the duration of these
        studies so that <br>technology studies is replaced by home economics, and
        handicraft and home economics by technology <br>studies. <br>Technology studies
        contributes to the development of five constituent skills: technology in our
        daily lives, <br>design and drawing, materials and their processing, home
        economics, and project work. The first three <br>constituents comprise approximately
        65% of the total duration; home economics 10%; and project work <br>25%. <br>Handicraft
        and home economics contributes to the development of four constituent skills:
        handicraft; <br>home economics; technology studies (when the study groups
        are switched) and project work. Handicraft <br>and home economics comprises
        approximately 65% of the subject, and at least one third of this is home <br>economics.
        Approximately 25% of the subject volume is dedicated to project work and 10%
        to technology <br>studies.  <br>The teacher decides how to arrange these parts
        during the school year in cooperation with the teacher of <br>technology studies.
        <br>The development of constituent skills and the sequence of topics during
        a school year is planned in <br>cooperation between the teachers of handicraft
        and home economics and technology studies. The <br>syllabuses for handicraft
        and home economics and technology studies contain a project study section
        that <br> <br>3 <br> <br>lasts for a quarter of the school year and takes
        place in a single instalment: the students can then select <br>either of the
        two study groups depending on their interests, irrespective of whether they
        are studying <br>technology or handicraft and home economics. Project work
        activities can be mutually integrated and also <br>integrated with projects
        in other subjects and inter-class projects, as well as with events that encompass
        <br>the whole school and longer-term events between schools. Project work
        is chosen in keeping with local <br>traditions, novel and conventional processing
        modes and interest in covering a certain topic in-depth. The <br>project work
        is independent and the students are not required to apply previously acquired

      label: 'The subjects in the field of technology support the development of knowledge,
        skills and values based on <br>both traditional and modern technology. The
        learning environment and study arrangements ensure a better <br>understanding
        of the objective world and development of cultural traditions and the world
        of technology.  <br>The subjects in this field teach how to see the connection
        between the topics discussed and the <br>surrounding living environment and
        facilitate application of education in different subjects and spheres of <br>life.
        Students learn to understand the choices faced during product development,
        and identify, combine and <br>analyse different environmentally friendly methods
        of implementation. Our society attaches great <br>importance to technological
        literacy. The students research and analyse phenomena and situations, use
        <br>various information sources and combine creative thinking and manual activities,
        which is important for <br>human physiological and mental development.  <br>Studies
        encourage students to propose new ideas in an environment where items are
        designed, modelled <br>and made, and the students also learn to present them.
        In joint discussions, students learn how to analyse <br>the product design
        process, to visualise, experience and evaluate different technical and creative
        solutions, <br>and to assess the product of their work. <br> The learning
        environment is positively inclined, with student diligence and development
        receiving the <br>utmost recognition, supporting initiative, enterprising
        spirit and creativity, and creating appreciation of <br>Estonian and global
        cultural creations and heritage. <br>These studies develop skills of independent
        work and cooperation, critical thinking, analysis and <br>assessment. By analysing
        various applied activities the students can make easier career choices and
        find <br>pleasant hobbies. <br>In technology studies the stress is on a modern
        technological mindset and development of ideals and <br>values required for
        employment. Taking into account sustainable development, the students acquire
        the <br>skills of coping with today’s rapidly changing world of technology.
        They learn to understand and analyse the <br>essence of technics and technology
        and their role in social development. The studies direct the students to <br>make
        connections between mental and manual activities and understand how what they
        learn at school is <br>connected with the living environment. Subject studies
        can be diversified by making use of local <br>opportunities. The contents
        of learning are combined with the solving of practical problems; the process
        of <br>planning and manufacturing a product in a class covers the entire development
        cycle, from idea generation <br>to product presentation. <br> <br> <br>4 <br>
        <br>The students taking handicraft lessons learn different handicrafts, four
        of which are compulsory: sewing, <br>knitting, crocheting and embroidery.
        The cross-curricular topics of design, work organisation, the basics of <br>folk
        art and study of materials are connected with both the compulsory subjects
        and various elective topics <br>and projects. Several subjects can be combined
        when making an item during practical work. <br>2nd stage of study primarily
        emphasises the acquisition of the main work methods and technologies and <br>the
        development of the skill of working in accordance with a manual or using auxiliary
        materials. Practical <br>work is performed every year, facilitating creative
        application of the technological methods learned. <br>3rd stage of study is
        focused more on creative work and informed work organisation. The subject
        is taught <br>in compliance with the product development cycle of a handicraft
        item: from information-gathering, idea <br>development, design, work scheduling
        and technological planning to actual performance and presentation <br>of the
        results. <br>The students in home economics classes acquire the skills and
        knowledge to cope with daily life tasks. In <br>addition to practical cooking
        classes, the students learn the basics of healthy eating and how to create
        <br>balanced diets. The students develop their housekeeping skills, assess
        consumers who act in an <br>environmentally friendly manner and know their
        rights and obligations, analyse consumer behaviour and try <br>to find connections
        and contradictions between health awareness and actual behaviour. Studying
        home <br>economics offers good opportunities to apply the knowledge acquired
        in theoretical subjects such as <br>biology, chemistry and mathematics.'

        to make decisions about their development and future employment. The knowledge
        of healthy nutrition <br>and eating disorders, acquired in home economics,
        teaches students to value a healthy lifestyle and create <br>preconditions
        for practicing this lifestyle. <br> <br>5 <br> <br>Learning to learn competence.
        The students learn to see and analyse connections between technology <br>and

        and chemistry, while health-conscious behaviour skills can be practiced through
        <br>practical assignments in the classroom, and studies are organised through
        teachers’ cooperation in <br>the school; <br> <br>8 <br> <br>5) the study
        activities in all subjects of the fields are designed with practical application
        in mind. It is <br>also taken into account that the theoretical and practical
        parts are alternating depending on the <br>students’ abilities and progress.
        The practice of product design facilitates acquisition of useful <br>knowledge,
        skills and attitudes. Activities are selected depending on the development,
        progress <br>and abilities of students; <br>6) the teacher makes sure that
        learning is varied so that the students can study different types of work
        <br>and topics, try processing various materials and become familiar with
        their properties through <br>manual work and creativity; <br>7) students are
        encouraged to express their opinions, to engage in group reflection on topics
        related <br>to the studies, and attention is paid to provision of value education;
        <br>8) a business-like and pleasant working environment is ensured in the
        classroom and student <br>creativity and initiative are supported; and <br>9)
        local opportunities are used to diversify subject studies. <br>In handicraft
        and home economics and technology studies:  <br>1) learning environments,
        teaching materials and means are used which are based on modern <br>information
        and communication technology; <br>2) the learning environment is expanded:
        library, computer/multimedia classroom, the natural <br>environment, companies
        school yard, exhibitions, museums, etc.; <br>3) different contemporary methods
        of teaching are used, including active learning (creative thinking, <br>practical
        and research activities, project studies, experiments, e.g., properties of
        different materials <br>and substances, organisation of events and exhibitions,
        use of online environments for presenting <br>and displaying one’s ideas and
        work, role-play, discussions, debates, etc.);  <br>4) the main emphasis is
        on a creative design process (design, testing, product improvement, etc.),
        <br>preservation of national work traditions (national products, folk art
        motifs used to adorn products <br>etc.) and modern technology; <br>5)  safety
        issues are addressed before use of any new processing methods or equipment,
        incl. work <br>instructions and demonstration of safe techniques; <br>6) the
        time allocation of learning contents – the number and sequence of lessons
        – is planned while <br>keeping in mind the recommendation to select two main
        techniques of work in handicraft, which <br>can be linked to recurrent topics
        within the subject (design, folk art, organisation of work, and <br>materials);
        <br>7) study is organised according to a project-based format (incl. projects
        that connect different subjects <br>and areas of life, cooperation with businesses,
        and cooperation between boys and girls in home <br>economics, handicraft and
        technology studies), which facilitates greater emphasis on local <br>traditions,
        presentation of and experimentation with various techniques, guiding students
        towards <br>individual and collective creative problem solutions and organisation
        of events related to the <br>subject; <br>8) when preparing food in home economics
        or performing other practical assignments, a class is <br>divided into smaller
        groups (1-5 students); <br>9) it is kept in mind that technology study is
        primarily based on the product/other development cycle; <br>10) the students’
        workload (including homework) should be moderate and evenly distributed throughout
        <br>the school year, leaving them sufficient time for rest and recreational
        activities; <br>11) the aim is to ensure that home assignments in handicrafts
        and technology studies are linked with <br>finding the necessary information,
        independent planning and organisation of work, and also with <br>product design
        in case of handicraft, avoiding excessive supervision;  <br> <br>9 <br> <br>12)
        the students go through the phases of searching for information, designing
        the product, making the <br>product and presenting it to fellow students;
        <br>13) adaptation of the contents and outcomes of learning to the ability
        of students.'

        field is to support students’ <br>development, motivate purposeful learning,
        guide the development of students’ self-esteem, create and <br>increase a
        lifelong interest in handicrafts and technology, guide and support students
        in the choice of their <br>future education path. Assessment supports development
        of students’ technology competence, <br>technological literacy and provides
        feedback on students’ individual development, constituting the basis for <br>the
        planning of subsequent studies. <br>Assessment is regulated according to the
        respective provisions of the national curriculum for basic schools <br>and
        both formative assessment and summarising grading are used, depending on the
        established learning <br>objective and the contents and goals of the curriculum.
        Important in student assessment are the verbal <br>appraisal provided by the
        teacher, the numerical grade and the student’s self-assessment. In the subjects
        <br>of the technology field, assessment also takes into account students’
        participation in subject olympiads, <br>contests, competitions and other such
        events. In the 9th Form, a final paper can be used for summarising <br>grading
        of students’ knowledge and skills. <br>In technology studies, assessment covers
        students’ work culture, technological literacy and the ability to <br>design
        and manufacture a product: <br>1) attitude towards learning, diligence, studiousness,
        persistence, attentiveness; <br>2) cooperation skills, helpfulness, independence

        study premises; <br>4) planning (originality, independence, possibility for
        idea/design implementation expediency) the <br>choice of materials and means,
        product-making method, technical correctness of the working <br>drawings etc.;
        <br>5) the skill of making and substantiating choices (idea, processing method,
        material etc.) and <br>describing connections; <br>6) production process (cooperation
        skill, working independently, the skill of using materials, means, <br>written
        and information technology resources, theoretical knowledge and skill in its
        application, <br>adherence to occupational safety requirements etc.); and
        <br>7) work results (implementation of the idea, product finishing, aesthetic
        value, timely completion of <br>work, product quality etc.), including performance
        of separate tasks and skills in product <br>presentation. <br>When assessing
        written assignments, teachers primarily take into account the content but
        also correct <br>spelling mistakes, which are not taken into account in assessment.'

        label: Handicraft and home economics is a subject that integrates the theoretical
          knowledge and practical skills <br>needed in daily life. Connections between
          handicraft and applied art facilitate creative self-realisation. The <br>students
          discuss connections between art, handicraft and fashion and the importance
          of handicraft and <br>light industry in the past and present. They become
          familiar with different materials and their properties and <br>try various
          techniques when using them.  <br>The students learn to see and find interesting
          and novel solutions when designing items and products. <br>They learn to
          value preservation and development of national culture traditions in handicraft
          and home <br>economics. It is national cultural traditions in handicraft
          and home economics. The students learn to note <br>the handicraft and food
          traditions of different countries and their connections with history, climate,
          religion <br>and cultural customs.  <br> <br>During home economics lessons
          the students learn the basics of healthy eating and how to create a <br>balanced
          menu; they learn to cook; they develop housekeeping skills. Students reflect
          on consumer <br>behaviour and understand the importance of consumers who
          act in an environmentally friendly manner and <br>know their rights and
          obligations; they analyse consumer behaviour and value consumers who act
          in an <br> <br>13 <br> <br>environmentally friendly manner and know their
          rights and obligations; and seek connections and <br>contradictions between
          health awareness and actual behaviour. <br> <br>Thus, the subject of handicraft
          and home economics shapes practical thinking and creativity and develops
          <br>manual activities, self-analysis abilities and technological literacy.
          The subject integrates the knowledge <br>acquired in other subjects. The
          creative and practical activities also carry the function of relaxation,
          both in <br>the context of school studies and subsequent life.

        label: 'During the 2nd and 3rd stages of study the course content consists
          of five constituent skills per stage:  <br>1) technology in our daily lives;  <br>2)
          design and drawing;  <br>3) materials and their processing;  <br>4) home
          economics (with study group switches); and  <br>5) project work.  <br> <br>
          <br>22 <br> <br>Education provides a general foundation and basic knowledge
          that the students must acquire to perform <br>the required tasks or make
          certain products. During the lessons the teacher integrates the course content
          <br>with practical activities (wood- and metalwork, electronics etc.). The
          course content and/or sequence can <br>be altered by stage or the knowledge
          and skills already acquired can be tackled in more depth at the next <br>stage.
          The teacher plans and arranges these parts during the school year in cooperation
          with the teacher of <br>handicraft and home economics. In the interest of
          subject diversity, the study groups of handicraft and <br>home economics
          and of technology studies are switched. <br>Education emphasises students’
          sensible and creative innovation where the joy of discovery is coupled with
          <br>an experience of producing something from idea to finished product.
          The students perform interesting and <br>imaginative practical tasks, including
          task or product planning, design and production, self-assessment and <br>presentation
          of results.  <br>Practical output and connections are revealed between school
          subjects and life spheres, fostering an <br>integral understanding in the
          students of the corresponding task or product. It is important for students
          to <br>understand how technology functions and personally participate in
          creation of technology that is suited to <br>students, incl. a functioning
          item.  These objectives are achieved in compliance with the contemporary
          <br>development level of the students and in a manner that is understandable
          to them. Different abilities and <br>interests are also taken into account,
          and self-initiative and learning motivation are supported. The subject <br>is
          taught stressing the importance of inventive activities and the young people’s
          work-related behavioural <br>attitudes and value judgements are shaped.
          The students are encouraged to value environmentally friendly <br>approaches
          and local traditions and acquire ethical convictions.'
