      label: 'Social studies investigage the functioning of human beings and society
        in the past and present. Study of social <br>subjects helps to integrate the
        contents of different subjects and to construct a complete picture of society,
        <br>while also developing the skill of understanding current developments
        in the light of historical phenomena. <br>Social studies develop the ability
        to recognise various links in the development of society, to make informed
        <br>choices, based on the values, norms and rules of society, and to act as
        a moral and responsible person and <br>member of society. The discussion of
        topics in social subjects helps to develop students’ preparedness to <br>contribute
        to elimination of inequality between women and men from society and to promotion
        of gender <br>equality. <br>Integration within the subject field is in the
        service of general objectives of the field. Integration is based on <br>topics,
        concepts and teaching methods. <br>The aim of the study of History is to develop
        students so that they are capable of analysing and understanding the <br>world
        that they live in and have a sense of the circumstances and events that have
        occurred in the world. In the <br>course of studying History students acquire
        knowledge of their home country and its past and the cultural heritage <br>of
        the world as well as different value systems necessary for orientation in
        their cultural space. This subject directs <br>students to acknowledge, analyse,
        assess and critically interpret the events and processes that took place in
        history, <br>the connections between them and links to today as well as reasons
        for different interpretations of historical events. <br>The general objective
        of personal, social and health education is to develop students’ social skills
        and to <br>contribute to students’ personality development, health awareness,
        knowledge of gender equality, skills <br>required for social life, and general
        human values. <br>In Civics and citizenship education students acquire social
        writing skills: knowledge, skills, values and <br>attitudes necessary for
        functioning in society and making responsible decisions. The aim of the subject
        is to <br>create the preconditions for the strengthening of the identity of
        a citizen and social cohesion, shaping active <br>citizens, supporting the
        formation of readiness for dialogue and respect towards people who understand
        the <br>world differently, as well as the self-awareness of students in questions
        regarding worldviews. <br>The subject teacher selects the learning content
        with the aim to ensure achievement of specified learning <br>outcomes, general
        and subject field competences. Particular contents of optional courses are
        specified at the <br>beginning of each course in cooperation between the teacher

      label: The subject field enables development of all general competences in daily
        education through theoretical <br>studies and practical activities. The teacher
        plays a crucial role in shaping the four interconnected components <br>of
        competences – knowledge, skills, values and behaviour – with the teacher’s
        values and self-assertion skills <br>creating a suitable learning environment
        and influencing students’ values and behaviour.  <br>All of the subjects in
        the subject field support the formation of cultural and value competence by
        means of <br>different emphases. For example, History, Civics and citizenship
        education and Geography support the ability <br>to understand humanism, the
        principal values of democracy and sustainable development and to follow these
        <br>principles in one’s own activities, as well as adopting a respectful attitude
        towards different cultures and <br>worldviews. Personal, social and health
        education supports the understanding of value systems, living in <br>harmony
        with thoughts, words and feelings and giving reasons for one’s choices, taking
        into account the well-<br>being of others in addition to one's own well-being.
        Civic and citizenship education teaches the skill to stand up <br>against
        violation of central norms and to follow the principles of social justice
        and equal treatment of different <br>genders.  <br>Personal, social and health
        education supports the development of students’ self-awareness competence;
        <br>teaches how to assess their weaknesses and strengths; lead healthy lives;
        and solve problems related to <br>themselves, their mental and physical health
        and relationships. The main support here is from Personal, social <br>and
        health education and other subjects in the subject field which help to develop
        the national and cultural <br>self-management of students. <br>Learning to
        learn competence. Each subject in the field of Social Studies shapes students’
        ability to organize <br>their study environment; to find tools and information
        necessary for study; and develops learning skills, the ability to <br>rationalise
        and plan studies and to apply the contents of learning in different contexts.
        <br>Communication competence. The ability to express oneself clearly and appropriately
        in different settings; to <br>read and understand informative and practical
        texts as well as fiction and to write different kinds of texts. All of <br>the
        subjects in the field support the use of appropriate language tools and style,
        and the valuing of correct <br>grammar and expressive language. <br>Mathematics,
        natural sciences and technology competence. Study of social subjects requires
        the ability to <br>analyse statistical data presented in different formats
        (graphs, tables, diagrams) and to draw conclusions <br>based on this data,
        to use mathematical symbols and methods for solving different problems (e.g.,
        in the <br>planning of timing and resources) and verifying the accuracy of
        the result. This is supported through learning <br>activities by all subjects
        of the field. Study of social subjects entails an overview of the development
        of <br>technology and manufacturing through societal change; recognition of
        opportunities and risks associated with <br>application of technologies; understanding
        of modern development trends of technology and the links between <br>technology
        and research; application of modern technology in an efficient and ethical
        manner for shaping <br>one’s learning, working and communication environment;
        purposeful and sustainable use of technological <br>resources in accordance
        with safety and copyright requirements. <br>Entrepreneurial competence. Entrepreneurial
        competence is shaped mainly through civics and citizenship <br>education with
        some contributions from other subjects of the field. Students learn to identify,
        analyse and solve <br>problems, establish goals, select suitable and creative
        methods for implementation of ideas, and cooperate in <br>order to achieve
        the goals.

      label: Cross-curricular topics are in the service of attaining general competences,
        enabling to identify suitable topics, <br>methods and study procedures for
        integrating subject courses and other learning activities. Cross-curricular
        <br>topics contribute to consistent development of competence in the social
        field by offering points of interest for <br>discussing topical issues in
        the context of education.  <br>Lifelong learning and career planning. Study
        of social subjects includes a discussion of the development of <br>various
        human activities during different time periods, economic processes in society
        and the impact of those <br>processes on human activity.  Different learning
        activities are used to guide students towards understanding <br>and appreciating
        lifelong learning as a lifestyle and to interpret career planning as a continuous
        decision <br>making process. Educational activities offer opportunities for
        direct contacts with the world of employment, <br>e.g., through visits to
        undertakings, presentations of occupations, professions and further education
        <br>opportunities related to the subject field. Educational activities enable
        students to deepen their knowledge of <br>the links between education and
        employment and of the legislation governing employment relationships.  <br>Education
        develops independent study skills and responsibility, as well as skills to
        find and analyse information <br>on further education opportunities, based
        on one’s development needs, and to prepare a career plan.  Various <br>learning
        activities, including independent projects, enable students to link their
        interests and abilities with <br>subject-specific knowledge and skills and
        to understand that hobbies can help to balance personal life and <br>career.    <br>Environment

        of the environment and on resolution of <br>environmental problems, recognise
        the interconnections between different parameters of humanity’s cultural,
        <br>social, economic, technological and human development. They learn to understand
        the risks associated with <br>5 <br> <br>human activities and the need to
        form personal opinions on environmental issues and to be a socially active
        <br>and responsible person. <br>Civil initiative and entrepreneurship. Students
        learn to value the organisation of democratic communality <br>and acquire
        cooperation skills, start fostering the ability to take initiative and appreciate

        The topic covers positive and <br>negative effects of technological development
        and ethical issues arising from the development and use of <br>technology.
        Students use information and communication technology (ICT) for solving real-life
        problems and <br>increasing the efficiency of studies and work.  <br>Health
        and safety. Students learn to analyse the impact of different choices and
        risk behaviours (incl. drugs) <br>and to make choices that are safe for their

      label: 'The general part of the upper secondary school curriculum is taken as
        the basis for evaluating the learning <br>7 <br> <br>outcomes of the study
        of history. Assessment is based on the provisions of the general part of the
        national <br>curriculum for upper secondary schools. Detailed assessment procedures
        are specified in the school <br>curriculum. The main purpose of assessment
        is to support students’ development in shaping a positive self-<br>concept
        and and adequate self-assessment, with students’ role in assessment recognised
        as being important <br>by providing opportunities for self-assessment. Diverse
        forms of assessment should be used for measuring <br>learning outcomes and
        assessment. The objective of testing and assessing learning outcomes is to
        receive an <br>overview of the level of attainment of learning outcomes and
        individual development of students in the subject, <br>and to use this information
        for more productive planning of studies. Students must know what is being
        <br>evaluated and when, what methods of assessment are being used and what
        the criteria for assessment are. <br>The testing and assessment of learning
        outcomes in history entails spoken and written assignments, work <br>with
        maps, documents, source material and pictures, compiling reviews and research
        papers, creative work <br>and discussion of subjects in writing. When evaluating
        the analysis of sources, the focus is on whether <br>students found important
        information from the source, how they interpreted it and compared it, how
        they <br>answered and made comments on the basis of extracts and how they
        decided on the credibility of the source. <br>Tasks that require analysis
        of the most important historical events and phenomena are preferred to individual
        <br>facts. When evaluating discussions, the focus is on how they correspond
        to the theme, knowledge of an era <br>and facts related to the topic, skills
        of analysis, comparison, making connections and drawing conclusions and <br>expressing
        personal attitudes through well-founded opinions. <br>In personal, social
        and health education, assessment is used for students knowledge and skills,
        while <br>feedback is provided to students on the development of attitudes
        and values. The forms for evaluating learning <br>outcomes are diverse, including
        oral, written and practical tasks. In the case of spoken and written tasks,
        <br>students: <br>1) explain and describe the content of concepts and the
        connections between them; <br>2) given an account of their own opinions, assessments,
        viewpoints and attitudes, connecting them to <br>their knowledge and everyday
        life; <br>3) differentiate between situations, states, activities and characteristics
        and compare and analyse them <br>according to learning outcomes; and <br>4)
        demonstrate their knowledge of facts, concepts and patterns according to the
        content of study tasks. <br>In the case of practical tasks, the students:
        <br>1) apply theoretical knowledge to practical study situations; <br>2) demonstrate
        the skills outlined in the learning outcomes in study situations; and <br>3)
        describe the application of the knowledge and skills outlined in the learning
        outcomes in everyday life. <br>In the case of practical work, not only the
        result but also the process is evaluated. The attitudes and values of <br>the
        students can be measured by observation and on the basis of assessments and
        resolutions and case <br>study analysis made by them.  <br>Civics and citizenship
        education. The assessment can be based on an ability to discuss subjects,
        <br>understand text and work with various sources (pictures, schemes, tables,
        texts and so on). Students are <br>evaluated and assessed in terms of their
        ability to explain and use terms, understand and analyse problems, <br>understand
        the nature of legal questions, participate in discussions, their skills in
        discussion, argumentation <br>and finding legal information and interpreting
        it, participation in common activities (simulations, role-play and <br>projects),
        correctness, completeness and precision in filling out forms, applications,
        reclamations and so on <br>and preparing and making presentations, overviews,
        summaries, research overviews, presentations and other <br>independent or
        group work. The overall grade of the course consists of grades for tests,
        practical work, <br>studies, independent work and presentations. The assessment
        is based on the independent carrying out of the <br>work and creativity and
        correctness in formulation. Practical work is on a specific topic or material.
        <br>Independent work is homework, classroom work and computer classroom work
        evaluated selectively. During <br>the course, homework, oral replies, exercises,
        participation in group work and the like may also be evaluated. <br>The compulsory
        course on ‘Population and economy´’, which is included in the field of social
        studies but <br>described under the field of natural sciences, constitutes
        a part of the study stage grade in geography. <br>8'

          context and to acknowledge and analyse the mutability and interpretability
          of past <br>phenomena, the links between them and their connections to today.
          The course looks at the everyday lives <br>and worldviews of people, changes
          in society, culture and ways of thinking (including values) and historical
          <br>figures and events from the student’s own and other people’s perspectives.
          The sequence of the courses for <br>upper secondary school studies in history
          is chronological and thematic; that is historical problems are <br>examined
          taking their chronological continuity into account. At the start of upper
          secondary school, students <br>are not able to make and see connections
          between areas that are chronologically and culturally distant, an <br>ability
          which is necessary for a thematic approach. <br>Students reach this thematic
          approach at the end of upper secondary school with the course Contemporary
          <br>History III, where they can place greater reliance on what they have
          studied previously. In course content, <br>within larger thematic blocks,
          the thematic approach for making comparisons and generalizations may be
          used <br>in all courses. <br>Large thematic blocks in Estonian history courses
          are precended by corresponding thematic blocks in general <br>history. The
          themes and concepts studied within the general history courses are not highlighted
          separately in <br>Estonian history courses. The sequence of studying the
          courses is defined in the national curriculum, but it is <br>sensible to
          follow the principle of chronological continuity; that is, the general history
          course comes first, then <br>Estonian history and contemporary history.
          <br>The main emphasis in upper secondary school History studies  is on a
          problem-based approach, analysing opinions <br>9 <br> <br>and interpretations
          from different viewpoints. In order to understand that the writing of history
          depends on the time <br>and the researcher, the course shapes the students’
          critical attitudes towards different ways of thinking, comparing <br>the
          interpretation of historical events and phenomena in different sources and
          assessing the credibility of these <br>sources. <br>In studies of history,
          cultural diversity is valued and the aim is to make the students understand
          that diversity <br>means richness in society and that it is a precondition
          for development. The role of the student in preserving <br>and carrying
          forward cultural heritage is acknowledged. The study of history supports
          the formation of <br>students’ self-definition and ability to put themselves
          in someone else’s shoes, looking at the world from other <br>viewpoints.
          <br>Students are encouraged to make connections and draw conclusions on
          the basis of discussion and analysis <br>and to form personal opinions and
          give reasons for them in a well-argued way. In order to develop critical
          <br>thinking, different sources and other study materials are used which
          show historical events from a different <br>viewpoint. Through analysing
          historical problems, the value systems of the students are enriched, their
          <br>national and cultural identity, tolerance and supportive attitudes towards
          democratic values are formed, their <br>historical thinking is developed
          and their historical consciousness is enriched. <br>Understanding history
          is supported by excursions, study tours, historical writing and fiction,
          theatre and <br>cinema, media, the Internet and different people and places.
          When this experience is united with what <br>students study at school, they
          gradually develop an understanding of history. Students'' worldview is enriched
          <br>by the integration of different subjects and the examination of related
          topics from various viewpoints. <br> <br>Through the teaching of history,
          different skills are developed: <br>1) the ability to orient oneself in
          time and the ability to find, analyse and understand connections and <br>make
          sense of the historic background of events and phenomena;   <br>2) knowing
          and using historical concepts in context and broadening terminology; <br>3)
          asking history-related questions and offering different solutions when responding
          to them; <br>4) functional literacy, critical thinking, the ability to discuss,
          drawing conclusions, making connections and <br>forming one’s own opinions
          and giving reasons for them; <br>5) empathy, the ability to put oneself
          in someone else’s shoes taking the historical era into account and <br>the
          ability to cooperate and solve conflicts; <br>6) analysis of sources and
          work with historical maps, finding information from different sources of
          <br>information and assessing the credibility of the source; and <br>7)
          spoken and written forms of expression, compiling review papers and historical
          research, using <br>information and communication technology tools to find
          information and presenting the results of one’s <br>work. <br> <br>The formation
          of skills in studies of history is an ongoing process that develops through
          studies of different <br>subjects. The presumed level of achievement of
          skills is described at the end of upper secondary school as <br>learning
          outcomes. <br> <br>History is studied in six compulsory courses: General
          History; Estonian History I (until the sixteenth and turn of the <br>seventeenth
          centuries); Estonian History II (until the end of the nineteenth century);
          Contemporary History I – <br>Estonia and the world in the first half of
          the twentieth century; Contemporary History II – Estonia and the world in
          the <br>second half of the twentieth century; and Modern History III – Main
          characteristics of the developments of the <br>twentieth century: Estonia
          and the world. There are also two optional courses in the subject field:
          General History – <br>World History: Civilization outside Europe; and General
          History – History of European countries and the United <br>States of America.
          Inside the larger thematic blocks of Estonian history courses there are
          corresponding blocks on <br>general history.'

          to <br>support the acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitudes that form
          the basis for the future family life of <br>students. The course supports
          development of students’ individuality, helps to interpret and analyse their
          role <br>21 <br> <br>in the family and to develop a sense of responsibility
          both in personal and social life. The family studies course <br>shapes,
          in particular, students’ self-determination, social and value competence.
          The course is also closely <br>linked with natural science subjects, literature
          and other subjects of the social field.  <br>Students get to know the demographic,
          social, economic and historical processes taking place in society and <br>the
          phenomena that influence the structures and processes of family life. Family
          studies integrate the <br>knowledge and skills acquired through social studies.

          case studies and brainstorming) and practical <br>tasks (for example, observation
          and interviews). <br>2) Teaching allows for both individual and collective
          learning. <br>3) Teaching connects life outside school with study (for example
          by means of. project work, research and <br>meeting different people), thus
          ensuring that the course is related to everyday life. <br> <br>The formats
          for checking and evaluating learning outcomes are methodologically diverse,
          thus creating <br>possibilities for individual and collective learning and
          making connections to everyday life. <br> <br>Teaching values and shaping
          attitudes as part of the conceptual study environment take place in a setting
          that <br>supports mutual understanding and is directed at developing positive
          thinking about students’ potential for <br>developing and functioning successfully.
          A favourable social study environment is one that is predominantly <br>based
          on respecting the individuality of students and their personal attitudes
          as well as making it possible for <br>them to express their opinions freely,
          take the initiative, participate and act both alone and with others. <br>Study

          with the development of <br>contemporary social sciences and social needs.
          Students acquire social literacy, that is the knowledge, skills, <br>and
          attitudes that are necessary for coping responsibly in a dynamic and multicultural
          environment. The aim of <br>the subject is to build the foundations for
          becoming active and competent citizens who can adapt to change, <br>who
          know how to relate to progress, who can shape their own civic positions
          and who are open to new ideas <br>and lifelong learning. <br> <br>Studying
          the subject will help students prepare for functioning as well-informed
          citizens in a democratic society. <br>Civics and citizenship education looks
          at the social relations and processes in contemporary society and introduces
          <br>the arrangement and functioning of the main areas of social life (economy,
          politics and law). All areas are analysed <br>with regard to society as
          an integrated whole and the position and roles of the individual. The knowledge
          acquired in <br>basic school about the functioning of the Estonian state
          and society is broadened to include the problems of Europe <br>and the world.
          In addition to Estonian and European themes, important global social problems
          are also discussed. <br> <br>Students encounter various areas of life and
          situations in society. In order to support the socialization and <br>formation
          of social competence, the national curriculum also includes a diverse range
          of topics from human <br>rights to copyright law and consumer protection.
          In a society that is changing fast, the task of the teacher is to <br>pay
          attention to topical themes and problems and discuss them with students.
          In this process, support is <br>provided to students to develop independent
          critical and analytical skills and the capacity to exercise will. This <br>helps
          them make their personal plans for life and understand people with different
          views and demographic and <br>socio-economic characteristics. <br> <br>The
          two courses of Civics and citizenship education consist of four thematic
          areas: society and its <br>development; the state and politics in a democratic
          society; the functioning of society; and globalisation and <br>sustainable
          development. <br> <br>I Society and its development  <br> <br>In this thematic
          area the focus is on: <br>1) looking at the elements of society as a social
          system: social structure (groups, strata and <br>communities) and social
          relations and processes (e.g. cooperation and conflict, authority, <br>subordination
          and resistance, integration and differentiation, exclusion and participation
          and mobility <br>and stratification); <br>2) analysing the norms and values
          regulating life in a society and institutional organization that have <br>evolved
          in different areas (e.g. family, state, market, law and media); <br>3) studying
          the nature and functions of the public and private sector, getting to know
          the structure and <br>activities of civil society and analysing the possibilities
          for and experience in inter-sectoral cooperation; <br>and <br>4) getting
          to know the different forms and stages of society, how contemporary society
          evolved and what its <br>main features are, paying special attention to
          the process of modernization in society and the development <br>of the information
          and knowledge society. <br> <br>II The state and politics in a democratic
          society <br>26 <br> <br> <br>In this thematic area the focus is on: <br>1)
          delving into the functioning of a democratic political system and the way
          it differs from non-democratic <br>regimes and explaining how totalitarian
          societies are at variance with humanitarian values; <br>2) unveiling the
          nature of the state based on the rule of law and the nature of the separation
          of powers; <br>examining the protection of human rights, the political rights
          of citizens and the opportunities for <br>exercising freedoms and institutions;
          explaining the reasons that may lead to the estrangement of <br>citizens
          from the state; looking at the advantages and shortcomings of different
          forms of democracy <br>and connecting them to problems in Estonian politics;
          <br>3) getting to know the main features and viewpoints of political ideologies
          in different areas of politics <br>(education, the social sphere, tax politics
          and so on); and <br>4) examining the developmental problems of parties and
          citizens’ associations in Estonia; getting to know <br>the electoral process
          and acquiring the skills to exercise voting rights; considering the inclusion
          of <br>citizens in the exercising of public authority and ways of influencing

          of parties, citizens’ associations and pressure groups and <br>acquiring
          the skills to organize legal civic initiatives and action. <br> <br>III
          Functioning of society <br> <br>This thematic area examines economics and
          helps to nurture the readiness of young people for different <br>career
          choices and active participation in economic life. During the course of
          study the focus is on: <br> <br>1) getting to know the laws and processes
          of the contemporary market economy and examining the <br>sources of national
          reserves and social welfare and factors affecting them; the differences
          between <br>private and public interests and principles of use of social
          resources; <br>2) becoming familiar with the directions of development of
          the Estonian economy and job market, <br>including the prospects of development
          of the knowledge-based economy and creative economy and <br>the most important
          legislation regulating enterprise and employment relationships. The development
          <br>of the Estonian economy is considered in the context of the EU and global
          economies; and <br>3) getting to know the basics of enterprise, enabling
          students to function in everyday life and realistically <br>assess their
          capabilities as entrepreneurs. <br> <br>IV Globalisation and sustainable
          development <br> <br>In this thematic area students broaden their knowledge
          of global problems and relevant factors. The aim here <br>is to see how
          each individual can contribute to making the world safer and more humane.
          This part of the <br>course focuses on: <br>1) learning to understand the
          diversity of the world; the interests of states; cooperation; problems arising
          <br>from the growth of the global information society and studying risk
          society; <br>2) looking at the role nation-states and international organizations
          play in today’s world and presenting <br>an overview of the challenges facing
          transnational cooperation (climate change and ecological <br>catastrophes,
          international terrorism, international migration, the fight against poverty,
          developmental <br>problems of the global economy and global population and
          so on); and <br>3) becoming familiar with the manifestations and consequences
          of globalisation. <br> <br>Civics and citizenship education nurtures the
          following views and attitudes of students: lawfulness and <br>personal responsibility;
          social justice and equal treatment of citizens; respect for human rights;
          respecting <br>intellectual property; tolerant attitudes towards difference;
          respect for different cultures; condemning prejudice <br>(including racism
          and xenophobia); sustainable ways of living and orientation towards lifelong
          learning. <br> <br>Civics and citizenship education integrates other knowledge,
          skills and values from Social Studies and lessons <br>learned at previous
          levels of education, while at the same time deepening the knowledge of society
          acquired earlier <br>27 <br> <br>through theory and practical activities.
          The studies are treated in such a way that on the one hand students acquire
          <br>a fuller picture of society and its relations, while on the other they
          always know how to assess their own position and <br>choices according to
          social context. <br> <br>Civics and citizenship education is closely connected
          to History, Geography, Biology and Personal, social and <br>health education.
          As in Geography, a more in-depth approach is taken towards the problems
          of population, <br>urbanization and the world economy and their connections
          with globalisation. At the same time, Civics and <br>citizenship education
          deepens students’ knowledge of the state that they have acquired through
          studies of history. <br>The optional courses in law, national defence, philosophy
          and religion further broaden students’ knowledge of their <br>own culture
          and society, and those of others, and highlight relevant aspects of multiculturalism
          and globalisation so <br>that they can make connections and recognize similarities
          and differences. <br> <br>The study material is presented in a problem-based
          way and is connected to everyday life as much as <br>possible. A great deal
          of attention is paid to raising students’ interest in the subject and fostering
          their <br>motivation for study. The course makes use of active study methods,
          such as discussions, case studies, <br>research projects and participation
          in civic action. Investigative methods of study are important, through which
          <br>students acquire skills in raising issues, formulating hypotheses, planning
          and carrying out work, thinking <br>critically and interpreting and presenting
          their results. <br> <br>Civics and citizenship education is enhanced by
          activities that include study trips, excursions, and meetings <br>with a
          variety of people and. In addition to course literature, various materials
          and informative texts, <br>documents, electronic databases, study films
          and so on are used.'
