      label: A language is a medium of national culture and national identity. Oral
        and written language proficiency is <br>the foundation of and prerequisite
        for the formation of an individual’s intellectual power, spiritual <br>development
        and socialisation. A good command of Estonian/Russian is a prerequisite for
        successful <br>learning in all subjects.  <br>In the subjects within the subject
        field, students acquire linguistic and literary knowledge and versatile <br>experience
        in reading, writing and communicating. Based on this knowledge and experience,
        students <br>should develop into knowledgeable, active and responsible readers,
        writers and communicators. First and <br>foremost, the subjects within the
        subject field support the development of the students’ native language and
        <br>literature competence as well as their communication skills, but also
        support the formation of students’ <br>identity and self-awareness as well
        as their cultural and social development. <br> <br>From Forms 1 to 4, all
        constituent linguistic skills (speaking, listening, reading, writing) and
        grammar skills <br>are developed in Estonian/Russian language education. Constituent
        skills and orthology are developed <br>through reading, reflecting on and
        writing informative, consumer and literary texts.  Starting from Form 5, <br>Estonian/Russian
        language and literature are separate subjects linked by a text-focused approach
        and the <br>development of constituent linguistic skills.  <br> <br>Literature
        lessons contribute to the formation of students’ interest in literature and
        reading ability, as well as <br>moral and emotional development through reflection
        of literary works, but they also deal with the specifics <br>of literary language
        and develop students’ oral and written self-expression skills.   <br>The basis
        for integration within the subject field is a broad concept of text, which
        includes oral and written <br>functional and literary texts, as well as pictorial,
        graphic and other types of texts.  <br>The interaction of the subjects within
        the subject field helps the students acquire the listening, speaking, <br>reading
        and writing strategies necessary for studying other subjects and develop the
        wish and ability to <br>express their ideas. <br> <br>Language use and the
        ability to understand and compose texts are developed through textual studies
        and <br>grammar lessons. Through studying Estonian/Russian language and literature,
        students acquire skills and <br>proficiency in linguistic communication, learn
        to express their thoughts and feelings, analyse what they <br>have heard and
        read and synthesise the information they have gathered. Reading literary texts
        and <br>analysing them during lessons broadens students’ insight into culture
        and life, enhances their vocabulary <br>and promotes their literary interests
        and the development of their reading abilities and personality. <br>The result
        of integration of constituent language skills is development of students’
        reasoning abilities, <br>communication skills and self-perception. Students
        are capable of ethical communication, considering the <br>circumstances and
        the partner, of informed learning and action.

      label: 'The study of subjects in the field of language and literature contributes
        to the development of all general <br>competences described in the national
        curriculum. This is accomplished by reading various texts, <br>contemplating
        on them through reflection and writing, and using different forms of cooperation
        (joint <br>discussions, projects, etc.). The attained general competences
        are reflected in text creation, presentations <br>and deliberations. The teacher
        plays a crucial role in shaping the four interconnected components of <br>competences
        – knowledge, skills, values and behaviour – with the teacher’s values and
        self-assertion skills <br>creating a suitable learning environment and influencing
        students’ values and behaviour.  <br> <br>Cultural and value competence. Literature
        education helps to form ethical and aesthetic-emotional values <br>and contributes
        to an understanding of cultural heritage though literary and functional texts.
        Language <br>education emphasises spiritual and cultural values: language
        as a carrier of national culture, language <br>proficiency as an important
        part of individual identity. Language education places value on functional
        <br>literacy and informed critical attitude towards information sources, incl.
        the media.  <br> <br>Social and citizenship competence. The use of work in
        pairs and group work in language and literature <br>lessons contributes to
        the development of cooperation skills, courage to express one’s opinions,
        ability to <br>recognise the ideas of peers and consider other people, to
        seek shared positions. Different types of <br>assignments are used to form
        the skill of ethical oral and written communication, taking into account the
        <br>circumstances, both in direct contact and online environments.  <br> <br>Self-awareness
        competence. Reflection on texts contributes to the development of a positive
        self-image <br>in students. Learning situations provide opportunities to adopt
        a position with regard to the topics <br>discussed, while creative assignments
        help to highlight students’ unique traits and talents and to shape a <br>worldview.  <br>
        <br>Learning to learn competence. Language teaching and literary studies develop
        the following essential <br>learning to learn competences: listening and reading
        competence; comprehending different text types; <br>differentiating between
        a fact and an opinion; seeking information from different sources and using
        it <br>critically; compiling texts of different types; and forming and formulating
        opinions.  <br> <br>Communication competence. Language and literature lessons
        contribute to oral and written <br>communication skills, the ability to understand
        the ideas and oral and written statements of conversation <br>partners, the
        ability to show consideration for the conversation partner and select a suitable
        behaviour, and <br>the skill to present and justify one’s opinions. Learning
        activities and study texts lay a foundation for <br>students’ skills of discussion,
        debate and modern written communication. <br> <br>Mathematics and natural
        sciences and technology competence. Informative texts are used to develop
        <br>the skill to read information graphs or other types of visual information,
        to find numerical data, to read and <br>understand information presented in
        tables, charts, graphs and diagrams, as well as to analyse and <br>interpret
        this information and to associate it with verbal information. Calculation
        skills are developed <br>through conversion of measurement units used in older
        texts. Students learn to differentiate between <br>scientific, literary and
        popular information and to use technological tools for creating, correcting
        and <br>presenting texts.   <br> <br>Entrepreneurial competence. The development
        of entrepreneurial initiative and responsibility is supported <br>by discussion
        of age-appropriate problems identified in media and literary texts, as well
        as in daily life, <br>adopting a position with regard to them and trying to
        find solutions both in language and literature lessons <br>and in creative
        assignments. The formation of entrepreneurship competences is promoted through
        the <br>students’ participation in projects which require their own initiative
        and activeness as well as applying their <br>linguistic and literary knowledge
        and enhancing it by using different sources.'

          is practiced in language and literature lessons. Discussions of nature in
          study texts and <br>fiction contribute to a better understanding and valuation
          of nature. The vocabulary and knowledge <br>acquired in natural sciences
          subjects foster an understanding of nature descriptions in literary works,

          of a worldview, an <br>understanding of historical events and orientation
          in social life and human relations. In selecting and <br>studying literary
          texts, the following important aspects of social life are taken into consideration:
          values and <br>morality; relationships at home and school; native culture
          and cultural diversity; civil society; and <br>international relations.
          The knowledge of history, of development and functioning of society, and

          of the specifics of artistic means of expression. Treatment of advertisements
          in language <br>studies requires differentiating and analysing visual and
          audio components. Illustrating an analysis of <br>literary works with the
          music of a given period helps students understand the emotional effect of

        separately from Estonian/Russian language studies starting from <br>Form 5.
        <br>Student assessment at the 2nd stage of study comprises: <br>1) reading
        and presentation of literary works; <br>2) narration; <br>3) interpretation
        and analysis of texts, understanding literary symbols; <br>4) presentation
        of text and original creation. <br>Student assessment at the 3rd stage of
        study comprises: <br>1) independent reading and different modes of narration;
        <br>2) interpretation, analysis and comprehension of text; <br>3) presentation
        of text and original creations. <br>In written literature assignments, the
        teacher also corrects orthographic mistakes, but assessment is based <br>mainly
        on the content of submission. In case of original creations, an extra grade
        can be used to recognise <br>the aesthetic aspect.'

        label: 'Estonian language proficiency is both the foundation of attainment
          of the objectives of the curriculum as <br>well as an objective of the curriculum.
          In basic school, students acquire knowledge and skills that enable <br>them
          to work with age-appropriate oral and written texts.  <br>Basic school lays
          the foundation for students’ social literacy, i.e., skill to use language
          in a knowledgeable <br>and critical manner for personal, public, educational
          and employment purposes. Students develop <br>knowledge and skills that
          cover language, its variants and different text types and enable them to
          be <br>successful in oral and written communication, to receive and create
          texts.  <br> <br>In Forms 1 to 4, Estonian language is a subject, which
          is integrated with literature, addressing the <br>objectives of both language
          and literary studies. Starting from Form 5, language and literature are
          separate, <br>but strongly integrated subjects, designed to develop, through
          different text types, purposeful reading and <br>writing skills. <br>In
          basic school, students need to acquire informed knowledge of written language
          and current Estonian <br>literary standard. The learning objectives of Estonian
          language are attained through several study fields.  <br> <br>At the first
          stage of study, students’ knowledge and skills are developed in three study
          fields: oral language <br>use (listening and speaking), reading and writing.
          Oral language use includes both self-expression in <br>everyday situations
          as well as understanding and communicating oral texts appropriate to a certain
          age. <br>Teaching reading seeks to develop the skills of working with texts,
          following instructions appropriate to a <br>certain age. Teaching writing
          seeks to develop students’ orthographic skills within the studied linguistic
          <br>forms and their ability to purposefully express themselves in writing.
          <br> <br>At the second and third stage of study, students’ knowledge and
          skills are developed in four study fields: <br>oral and written communication,
          text reception, text creation and orthology and language planning. <br>
          <br>Teaching oral and written communication seeks to develop students’ skills
          in interacting bilaterally or <br>multilaterally face-to-face, by post or
          e-mail and in an online setting, to summarise and mediate texts. <br> <br>The
          study on how to receive texts helps to build the skill of choosing and finding
          texts, focused reading and <br>listening; it provides information on listening
          and reading strategies and enhances the ability to comprehend <br>texts
          and to respond to them.  <br> <br>Teaching text creation seeks to develop
          versatile and purposeful self-expression skills so that individuals <br>perceive
          a situation and the addressee and are able to express and communicate their
          ideas with sufficient <br>precision and in the form specific to the text
          type. <br> <br>Teaching orthology and language planning seeks to develop
          linguistic awareness and knowledge. Students <br>develop the skill of knowledgeable
          use of the current Estonian literary standard, acquire an understanding
          <br>of language development and change, receive knowledge of the multitude
          of styles and diversity of <br>literature available in the literary standard
          and dialects.'

        label: 'Literature is a subject that develops students’ skills as readers,
          as well as the ability of symbolic thought <br>and verbal creation. Interpretation
          and analysis of serious literature and folklore helps to develop students’
          <br>aesthetical and ethical attitudes, enrich the sphere of emotions and
          contributes to formation of personality, <br>identity and a unique worldview.   <br>
          <br>Literary studies in basic school focus mainly on reading fiction and
          interpreting it. Special attention is paid <br>to developing skills that
          support the understanding of writing, literary work as a whole and its figurative
          <br>language. In order to develop the ability of interpretation and synthesis,
          the study of literature also includes <br>presentation of texts and original
          creation of different types of texts by students.  <br> <br>In order to
          discuss literary works and understand them in depth, students need to be
          familiar with literary <br>metalanguage and the author’s cultural and historic
          background. The terms necessary for treating literary <br>works are explained
          in the study literature: students’ own explanations are expected only in
          the case of a <br>terms separately pointed out in the learning content.
          Thus, the theoretical aspect of literary studies is <br>minimum, as it is
          far more essential to arouse and maintain students’ interest in reading
          and develop their <br>interpretation skills than give them factual knowledge.
          <br> <br>A diverse selection of texts helps to shape reading and analysis
          experiences and develop reading skills. <br>The reading list includes works
          that facilitate discussion of major ethical and aesthetical issues from
          both <br>recent literature and classics. Attention is also paid to folklore
          material to enhance appreciation of students’ <br>origin and cultural affiliation.
          The reading list is compiled to ensure reasonable proportions of Estonian
          and <br>world literature, older and newer literature and different genres
          of prose, drama and poetry and to cover <br>appropriate subject areas for
          the particular study stage. In the interests of cultural continuity, the
          <br>recommended selection of complete works to be discussed also includes
          a number of core texts. The <br>recommended selection can be used to prepare
          a specific list of works based on the learning style and <br>abilities of
          particular class. In addition, there are options for choosing relevant texts
          and works related to a <br>topic, including from local and recent literature.
          The teacher selects at least four complete works from the <br>list for examination
          in every form. The teacher can base the selection of literary works on the
          preferences <br>or cultural/ethnic characteristics of students.   <br> <br>In
          order to develop functional literacy, informative texts have to be examined
          in literature lessons as well. <br>Such texts are primarily related to literature,
          authors and other culturally significant individuals. Texts on <br>cultural
          history facilitate exploration of personality-developing circumstances,
          contribute to a better <br>understanding of the literary and historical
          background of literary works, highlight the essential aspects of <br>Estonian
          culture, and create interest in cultural history.   <br> <br>The study process
          should provide students with plenty of creative writing opportunities based,
          among other <br>things, on literary works, other texts and their experiences
          in order to develop and acknowledge their <br> <br>24<br>creativity and
          intellectual power and highlight the authors’ personality and talent. In
          text analysis and <br>creation, oral and written study activities are equally
          important. <br> <br>Literary studies are connected with almost every subject
          (first and foremost Estonian) and other areas <br>close to literature (folklore,
          theatre, film and the fine arts) and support with their learning contents
          the <br>examination of cross-curricular topics and attainment of general
          competences. The nature, depth and main <br>emphasis of examining cross-curricular
          topics differ by form and depend to a great extent on the selection <br>of
          literature. Overall, it is expected that when students discuss the literary
          texts they have read, they will <br>relate themselves to the themes covered.'

        label: '34<br>Language proficiency is key to understanding and appreciating
          national culture. Good Russian proficiency <br>is the precondition of successful
          learning of all subjects in a Russian-language school. The subjects of the
          <br>subject field primarily support the development of competences in native
          language and literature and <br>enhancement of communication skills among
          basic school students. These subjects provide knowledge of <br>language
          and literature and offer various experiences of reading, writing and communicating.
          The subjects <br>of the subject field also support formation of students’
          identity and self-esteem, as well cultural and social <br>development.  <br>From
          Forms 1 to 4, Russian is a subject that develops four constituent linguistic
          skills (speaking, listening, <br>reading, writing) and orthography through
          the reading of informative, functional and literary texts, reflection <br>and
          writing, and establishes preliminary knowledge of phonetics, orthoepy, orthography,
          lexicology, <br>phraseology, morphemics and grammar. The study of Russian
          is mainly practical at the first stage of study. <br>Students acquire basic
          knowledge of language and literature, learn how to speak, read and write
          correctly <br>and to listen in a focused manner; education also develops
          students’ attention and interest in reading. <br>From Form 5, Russian language
          and literature are two different subjects, which are linked by a text-centric
          <br>approach and development of constituent linguistic skills. The study
          of literature is aimed primarily at the <br>enhancement of students’ interest
          in literature and reading ability as well as ethical and emotional <br>development
          through the reading and interpretation of literary works, but it also deals
          with the specifics of <br>literary language and develops students’ oral
          and written self-expression skills.  <br>The second study stage expands
          students knowledge of phonetics, orthoepy, lexicology, phraseology, <br>morphemics,
          morphology and syntax, and develops orthographic and punctuation skills.
          Text analysis <br>requires examination of the structure of text, formulation
          of the main idea, determination of speech type and <br>style, identification
          of figurative expressions and connections used in the text. The study of
          orthography is <br>based on texts. <br>Students develop an informed attitude
          towards speech, either their own or others’, and a skill to <br>communicate
          in an adequate manner in different situations. In reading and writing, the
          emphasis is on <br>comprehending the texts of others and creating own texts.
          Listening comprehension is important. Attention <br>is also paid to developing
          the skill to use neutral and expressive linguistic means. <br>The study
          of phonetics, orthoepy, morphology and orthography concludes at the third
          stage of study <br>(Forms 7–9) and this stage includes systematic work with
          syntax and punctuation. Students acquire basic <br>knowledge of text as
          a linguistic and speech unit, the particular features of text structure,
          creation and <br>comprehension of texts, and associations between different
          types of text. All rhetoric skills are refined with <br>the aim to attain
          communicative competence in basic areas of speech actions. The main emphasis
          is on <br>the development of various speech forms in particular situations
          and the skill to use resources of all <br>linguistic levels for self-expression
          depending on situation. Students learn to comprehend, analyse and <br>create
          various texts. <br>Correct and coherent speaking and diverse vocabulary
          are developed throughout basic school. The degree <br>of independence in
          working with texts is gradually increased: text comprehension, interpretation,
          creation of <br>texts in different genres and styles.  <br>The subject teacher
          selects the contents of education in consideration of achievability of the
          learning <br>outcomes, general and subject field competences specified for
          that study stage.'

        id: 73
        label: Literature is a subject that develops students’ skills as readers,
          as well as the ability of symbolic thought <br>and verbal creation, using
          primarily fictional works as a resource. Interpretation and analysis of
          serious <br>literature and folklore helps to develop students’ aesthetical
          and ethical attitudes, enrich the sphere of <br>emotions and contributes
          to formation of personality, identity and a unique worldview. <br>The subject
          contributes to the development of students’ skill to delve into the meaning
          of a text, understand <br>the problems discussed in the text and analyse
          literary works independently, relying on historical-literary <br>and theoretical
          knowledge as necessary. Teaching combines practical analysis and interpretation
          of texts <br> <br>44<br>to guide emotional and critical reception of literary
          works and educate cultured readers who are capable of <br>recognising true
          works of art.   <br>The subject prioritises examination of Russian literature,
          including folklore, and literature that is associated <br>with the ethnic
          origin and cultural community of students. students who understand different
          cultures – who <br>are tolerant towards and respect other national cultures
          – requires love and respect for their own national <br>culture and understanding
          its place in the cultural heritage of the world. Discussion of works by
          Estonian <br>and foreign authors supports an understanding of the links
          and mutual influences between the literature of <br>different nations, as
          well as adoption of generally accepted human values.   <br>The main criterion
          for selecting literary works is their artistic value, humanist goals, positive
          influence on <br>students’ personality and the relevance of the problems
          posed in the work to the moral education of <br>students and to developing
          tolerance. In selecting literary works for reading and classroom examination,
          it <br>is important to consider both the psychological and intellectual
          abilities as well as the interests of the <br>specific age group; how the
          works relate to the students’ life experience; and themes and problems that
          are <br>appropriate for discussion. It is also essential that the literary
          texts selected represent varied genres. <br> <br>The subject syllabus of
          literature presumes an understanding of the problems in the literary works
          <br>examined, forming own attitudes towards them, participating in discussions
          on the material read, taking into <br>account the opinions of others and
          well-grounded argumentation of own opinions. As a literary work, like <br>any
          piece of art, has multiple levels, it is possible to look at every literary
          text through the prism of different <br>problems and this in turn enables
          students to return to problems covered previously. <br>The study of literary
          works in basic school is based on the principles of creativity, communicativeness
          and <br>stadiality. The principle of creativity requires an activity-based
          approach to literature, with the main <br>emphasis on the all-around development
          of students’ creative potential. Within the communicative <br>approach,
          learning is seen as a dialogue-like process in which the students are fully
          licensed actors. The <br>artistic reception of literary works is also understood
          as a communicative activity. The principle of stadiality <br>in examining
          literary works presumes the application of didactic tasks at every stage
          of learning that are in <br>line with the students’ aesthetic needs and
          their level of creative abilities. The theoretical aspect of literature
          <br>studies is kept to a minimum, because it is more important to create
          and maintain an interest in reading and <br>develop interpretation skills
          than to impart factual knowledge.  <br>In the course of studying literature,
          students acquire the necessary historical and literary knowledge, come <br>to
          understand the meaning of literary terms and learn to use of them. The reading
          list is compiled to ensure <br>reasonable proportions of Russian, Estonian
          and world literature, older and newer literature and different <br>genres
          of prose, drama and poetry. The teacher can use the recommended selection
          of complete works to <br>prepare a specific list, based on the interests,
          the learning style and abilities of particular class. The teacher <br>selects
          at least four complete works to be examined in each form.  <br>The specific
          areas of study activities include text reading, paraphrasing, interpreting
          and analysing, <br>development of figurative thinking and expressive language
          use and creative activities (creative writing and <br>public presentations).
          <br>Literature studies are connected with almost every subject but primarily
          with areas related to Russian <br>language and literature (history, folklore,
          theatre, film and the fine arts) and support with their learning <br>contents
          the examination of cross-curricular topics and attainment of key competences.
          The nature, depth <br>and emphasis in discussing cross-curricular topics
          can be different depending on the class, being largely <br>dependent on
          the particular selection of literary works. The aim is to enable students
          to adopt their own <br>positions with regard to the topics covered, based
          on the fictional texts they have read. <br> <br>45<br>The subject teacher
          selects the contents of education in consideration of achievability of the
          learning <br>outcomes in constituent skills, general and subject field competences
          specified for that study stage.
