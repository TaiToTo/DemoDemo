    label: '1.1 Foreign languages competence <br> <br>The objective of teaching foreign
      languages in basic school is to develop students’ age-appropriate foreign <br>language
      competence, i.e., the ability to understand and interpret the content presented
      in a foreign <br>language, both orally and in writing, by following relevant
      cultural practices; to understand and value <br>different cultures and the similarities
      and differences between native and other cultures; to understand that <br>knowledge
      of several foreign languages is necessary in life. <br> <br>In developing these
      competencies basic school graduates will be expected to possess the capability
      to be <br>able to: <br>1) have acquired language proficiency at a level which
      enables them to act independently in authentic <br>foreign language environments;
      <br>2) are able to take part in different projects in foreign languages, continue
      their studies in a non-native <br>language and are competitive in their future
      work life; <br>3) have acquired knowledge  about nations speaking different
      languages and  about their cultures; <br>4) understand own culture and value
      the similarities and differences between their own and other <br>cultures; and
      <br>5) have mastered the necessary skills for further studies which enhance
      their self-confidence in <br>learning foreign languages and communicating in
      them.'

      label: 'Foreign languages broaden people’s cognition and their ability to understand
        and value the multicultural <br>world. They develop systematic thinking and
        self-expression opportunities with the help of varied linguistic <br>and non-linguistic
        means. By giving knowledge on different countries and people who speak different
        <br>languages, foreign languages develop students’ ability to communicate
        in a culturally informed way. <br> <br>The study of foreign languages in the
        subject field is based on the Common European Framework of <br>Reference for
        Languages and the language proficiency levels set out therein. The learning
        outcomes of all <br>foreign languages (including Estonian as a second language)
        have been described on a uniform basis as <br>set out in the Framework. Learning
        outcomes in different constituent skills have been presented at the end <br>of
        the subject field syllabus in Clause 2.4, in the table explaining the levels
        of language proficiency. <br>The implementation of the principles of the Framework
        and the European Language Portfolio in the study <br>process motivates students
        to learn foreign languages by taking into account learners’ age-specific and
        <br>individual characteristics and guides students of differing abilities
        to set achievable personal learning goals, <br>and gives  them objective feedback
        on their performance. All this facilitates enduring learning motivation <br>and
        the formation of independent learners. <br>Present-day language instruction
        is directed towards communication needs and focuses on learners and <br>their
        communication objectives. The most essential thing in language studies is
        the skill of using the <br>language and not merely being familiar with the
        structure of the language. Learners will develop correct use <br>of the language
        through long term practice. <br>Communication competence is formed through
        developing the four constituent skills of language <br>proficiency – listening,
        reading, speaking and writing –, and therefore the learning outcomes have
        also <br>been presented according to constituent skills. These constituent
        skills are taught integrally. <br>Language studies enhance thinking, develop
        clear self-expression skills, create texts and understand them. <br>In these
        areas, teaching a foreign language is supported by teaching the native language
        and vice versa. <br>Basic school students develop the skill to compare the
        similarities and differences between their own and <br>other cultures, to
        understand and value the uniqueness of other cultures and languages, to be
        tolerant and <br>refrain from developing biased attitudes towards everything
        that is foreign. Being familiar with other cultures <br>helps students to
        perceive the specifics of native culture and language more knowledgeably.
        <br>Foreign language instruction calls for open and flexible teaching methods,
        which enable the instruction to <br>be adjusted according to learners’ needs.
        <br>The essential principles in learner-centred teaching of foreign languages
        are: <br>3 <br> <br>1) learners’ active participation in the study process,
        their knowledgeable and creative use of foreign <br>languages and formation
        of learning strategies; <br>2) accord between the content of the study materials
        used in language teaching and learners’ <br>interests; <br>3) implementation
        of different forms of active learning (including pair work and group work);
        <br>4) the changed role of teachers from intermediaries of knowledge to partners
        who guide students in <br>the process of acquiring knowledge; and <br>5) versatile
        study materials adjusted and revised based on the goals and needs of learners.
        <br> <br>As a foreign language is first and foremost a means for obtaining
        and sharing information in the <br>communication process, language studies
        primarily focus on the thematic areas, which support the <br>formation of
        communication competence and its scope. These are common to all foreign languages;
        <br>variations in working with the thematic areas result from the duration
        of studies and number of lessons.'

      label: The following interrelated components are distinguished in the competences
        – knowledge, skills, value <br>judgements and conduct. In teaching these four
        components, teachers play a central role, as their value <br>judgements and
        assertive abilities create an appropriate learning environment and influence
        the value <br>judgments and conduct of their students. <br>The learning objectives
        and learning outcomes of the foreign languages instructions comprise language
        <br>competence, cross-cultural competence (value judgements, conduct) and
        learning skills. <br>By teaching foreign languages, all general competences
        (value competence, social competence, self-<br>management competence, learning
        to learn competence, communication competence, mathematics <br>competence
        and entrepreneurship competence) are developed by following the set aims and
        themes to be <br>examined and by implementing different teaching methods and
        study activities. <br>Cultural and value competence is supported by becoming   familiar
        with the cultures of countries where <br>different languages are spoken. Students
        learn to understand and accept different value systems based on <br>cultural
        specifics. <br>Social and citizenship competence. In order to cope in different
        every-day communication situations, it is <br>essential to know and use appropriate
        linguistic forms; it is also vital to know the cultural background, rules
        <br>of conduct and social practices of the countries where the foreign language,
        being studied, is spoken. Thus, <br>social and citizenship competence is closely
        related to value competence. The formation of social and <br>citizenship competence
        is facilitated by using different forms of study (e.g. group work, project-based
        <br>teaching) and active participation in cultural programmes related to the
        language learned. <br>Self-awareness competence is developed through the themes
        studied in foreign language. Issues related <br>to human relations and oneself
        can be approached in foreign language lessons through discussions, role <br>plays
        and other activities that help students better understand themselves. Assessing
        personal strengths <br>and weaknesses is closely related to the development
        of learning to learn competence. <br>Learning to learn competence is consistently
        formed by implementing different learning strategies (e.g. <br>seeking information
        from sources in foreign languages, using dictionaries). Self-reflection and
        analysing <br>acquired knowledge and skills (e.g. according to the European
        Language Portfolio) are also important. <br>Communication competence is the
        central competence in teaching foreign languages. The objectives of <br>foreign
        language teaching proceed directly from the components of communication competence
        and their <br>content. Good self-expression skills and ability to understand
        and create texts are prerequisites of <br>successful communication in foreign
        languages. Together with communication competences, students <br>develop the
        skill to compare the similarities and differences between their own and foreign
        cultures and to <br>4 <br> <br>value the specific features of other cultures
        and languages, to be tolerant and avoid a prejudiced attitude <br>towards
        the unfamiliar. The skills of good self-expression, text understanding and
        text creation are <br>prerequisites for successful communication in foreign
        languages. <br>Mathematics and natural sciences and technology competence
        is associated with foreign language <br>through communication competence.
        First, students learn how to calculate in a foreign language, for <br>instance,
        and then, as their language proficiency increases, to understand texts from
        different walks of life <br>and activities, incl. information graphics or
        other types of visual information. Students learn to use <br>technological
        tools for creating, correcting and presenting different types of text.  <br>Entrepreneurial
        competence is primarily supported by confidence and courage that people who
        can <br>speak a foreign language possess. Coping in a foreign-language environment
        broadens learners’ chances <br>in implementing their ideas and goals and creates
        preconditions for cooperation with their contemporaries <br>and likeminded
        individuals speaking the same foreign language.

          to recognise distinctive cultural features <br>and follow generally accepted
          rules of behaviour; to develop personal opinions and act as active and <br>responsible
          citizens. <br> <br>Art subjects. A connection with art competence is created
          through development of cultural awareness by <br>learning about cultural
          achievements of different countries through particular topics (e.g., “Countries
          and <br>their culture”, “Spare time”) as well as through direct experiences
          of art (cinema, theatre, concerts, music, <br>5 <br> <br>exhibitions, museums,
          etc.). Students are guided to notice and value different cultural traditions
          and the <br>diversity of world culture.  <br> <br>Technology. Different
          content fields and the source texts and learning therein are used to create
          <br>awareness of technological development trends, including, for instance,
          discussion of opportunities and <br>risks associated with the use of technology
          or a review of research achievements in different fields.  <br>Physical
          education. Physical education competence is associated with foreign languages
          through <br>appreciation of a healthy lifestyle and physical activity. Foreign
          language education (like physical <br>education) requires a tolerant attitude
          towards one’s peers, compliance with fair play rules and ability to <br>cooperate.'

        the use of appropriate source (authentic) texts in foreign languages and by
        applying working <br>methods that develop different competences. <br>Cross-curricular
        topics are first and foremost related to the following thematic areas: <br>1)
        Lifelong learning and career planning: ‘Learning and Working’. Education develops
        independent <br>learning skills as a crucial foundation of lifelong learning
        habits and attitudes. Different forms of <br>study are used to develop students’
        communication and cooperation skills, which are also <br>important for future
        employment. Foreign language education provides students with the necessary
        <br>vocabulary for self-analysis and self-presentation to be able to introduce
        themselves in a foreign <br>language and to communicate their thoughts in
        a comprehensible manner. Education offers <br>opportunities for direct contacts
        with the world of employment, e.g., through visits to undertakings, <br>presentations
        of occupations, professions and further education opportunities related to
        the subject <br>field. This contributes to the students’ skill to prepare
        necessary documents for continuing their <br>studies and applying for work.
        <br>2) Environment and sustainable development: ‘Estonia – My Home’. The aim
        is students’ <br>development into socially active, responsible and environmentally
        conscious individuals who <br>preserve and protect the environment and, valuing
        sustainability, are prepared to seek answers to <br>issues related to environmental
        and human development. <br>3) Citizens’ initiative and entrepreneurship: ‘Me
        and others ’, ‘Daily Life. Learning and Working’, <br>‘Estonia – My Home’,
        ‘Spare Time’. The aim is students’ development into active and responsible
        <br>members of community and society who understand the functioning principles
        and mechanisms of <br>society and the importance of civic initiative, feel
        that they are members of society and rely in their <br>activities on the country’s
        cultural traditions and development directions. <br>4) Cultural identity:
        ‘Estonia – My Home’, ‘Countries and Their Culture’. The aim is students’ <br>development
        into culturally conscious individuals who understand the importance of culture
        in <br>shaping human thinking and behaviour and the change of cultures throughout
        history, who have an <br>understanding of the diversity of cultures and the
        specific features of practical life determined by <br>culture, and who value
        their own culture and cultural diversity, are tolerant and willing to cooperate.
        <br>5) Information environment: ‘Daily Life. Learning and Working’, ‘Countries
        and Their Cultures’, ‘Spare <br>Time’. The aim is students’ development into
        information-conscious individuals who can sense and <br>acknowledge the information
        environment, are capable of critical analysis of this environment and <br>of
        action that corresponds to their objectives and socially accepted communication
        ethics. <br>6 <br> <br>6) Technology and innovation: ‘Daily Life. Learning
        and Working’, ‘Spare Time’ The aim is students’ <br>development into individuals
        who can accept innovations and use modern technology for its <br>intended
        purpose, who are able to navigate rapidly changing technological living, learning
        and work <br>environments. <br>7) Health and safety: ‘Me and others ’, ‘My
        Home and Surroundings’, ‘Daily Life. Learning and <br>Working’. The aim is
        students’ development into mentally, emotionally, socially and physically
        <br>healthy members of society who observe a healthy lifestyle, behave in
        a safe manner and <br>contribute to the development of a health-promoting

        values <br>and moral principles, who follow them inside and outside of school,
        who are not indifferent if those <br>principles are being disregarded, and

        label: 'For most students, foreign language A is their first contact with
          another language and culture. A key <br>objective in teaching foreign language
          A is to provoke students’ interest in other languages and cultures, <br>and
          to build their motivation to learn foreign languages. Acquiring a foreign
          language as a means of <br>8 <br> <br>communication is a process requiring
          continuous effort and active involvement of learners. Learning skills <br>acquired
          in studying foreign language A are cornerstones for acquiring other foreign
          languages. The <br>development of learners’ command of the language is also
          supported by CLIL (Content and Language <br>Integrated Learning).The instruction
          is based on the principles of communicative teaching. The emphasis is <br>on
          interactive learning and practicing the language studied. <br>Communicative
          language proficiency (communication competence) includes three components:
          linguistic, <br>sociolinguistic and pragmatic. Knowledge of the language
          is not an aim in its own right, but a means for <br>achieving better command
          of the language. The structure of the language is studied in context; grammar
          <br>rules are knowledgeably learned stage-by-stage. Through sociolinguistic
          competence learners develop <br>their ability to use the language appropriately
          in different situations (rules of politeness, language registers, <br>etc.).Through
          pragmatic competence learners improve their ability to understand and create
          texts. <br>Communication competence is developed through linguistic activities
          (listening, reading, speaking and <br>writing). <br>The backbone of language
          learning consists of thematic areas, which support the formation and scope
          of <br>communication competence. In basic schools, the starting point in
          studying the themes is ‘Me and My <br>Surroundings’. At every stage of study
          and in every form, themes from all thematic areas are covered, but <br>to
          varied extent and by focusing on different things. In addressing the themes,
          the experiences, interests <br>and needs of the students at a respective
          stage of study are taken into account. The language of instruction <br>in
          language lessons is mainly the foreign language which the students are studying.
          If necessary, native <br>language can be used for giving explanations. <br>The
          development of learning skills, including the skill of setting learning
          goals and analysing personal <br>results by using the European Language
          Portfolio or learning portfolio is equally important. Learning skills <br>acquired
          though learning foreign language A support acquisition of subsequent foreign
          languages. <br>Activities that require purposeful use of the language and
          integrate different aspects of language <br>proficiency play a central role
          in learning foreign languages. In planning study activities, basic didactic
          <br>principles are followed (from near to far,  from familiar to unfamiliar,
          from simple to complex, from concrete <br>to abstract) and needs of language
          use are taken into account (starting from more common words and <br>forms).
          Pair and group work are essential at all stages of study. Students are guided
          to work more <br>independently by performing tasks appropriate to their
          age (read, find information, participate in projects, <br>etc.). <br>Students
          are encouraged to use the language they learn outside of language lessons
          in order to establish <br>closer contacts with the language studied and
          develop their communication competence and cultural <br>awareness. This
          can be achieved by different tasks: independent reading, seeking information
          from <br>different sources or projects where students work together under
          the teacher’s supervision and use all <br>constituent skills. To motivate
          students, it is advisable to help them find pen-friends, organise field
          trips and <br>student exchanges, and to invite native speakers of the language
          they study to language lessons. <br>It is essential to motivate learners
          at every stage of study and develop their positive attitudes towards <br>language
          learning. In order to experience a sense of achievement, a positive atmosphere
          is created in the <br>classroom and all accomplishments of learners are
          recognised. Efforts made to achieve the results are <br>acknowledged as
          well. Mistakes are considered normal elements in language learning; their
          analysis <br>facilitates understanding and enables the students to correct
          their language use.'

        label: 'Learning foreign language B as a second foreign language enables students
          to broaden their <br>communication opportunities and cultural horizons,
          ensures access to knowledge sources and creates <br>preconditions for direct
          communication, and supports their further studies and activities in society.
          It is <br>important that different languages are taught constructively and  that
          they support each other, especially in <br>terms of seeing links with foreign
          language A. The learning experience and skills acquired in studying <br>foreign
          language A support studying foreign language B. The knowledge which students
          acquire on the <br>culture and country of the language they learn through
          other subjects is also taken into account. <br>Acquiring a foreign language
          as a subject and as a means of communication is a process, which requires
          <br>continuous effort and active involvement of learners. In language lessons,
          students and teachers mainly <br>communicate in the foreign language that
          the students study. If necessary, native language can be used for <br>giving
          explanations. Instruction is based on the principles of communicative teaching.
          The emphasis is on <br>interactive learning and practicing the language
          studied. <br>Communicative proficiency of the language (communication competence)
          includes three components: <br>linguistic, sociolinguistic and pragmatic.
          Knowledge of the language is not an aim in its own right, but a <br>means
          for achieving better command of the language. The structure of the language
          is studied in  context; <br>grammar rules are knowledgeably learned stage-by-stage.
          Through sociolinguistic competence learners <br>develop their ability to
          use the language appropriately in different situations (rules of politeness,
          language <br>registers, etc.). Through pragmatic competence learners improve
          their ability to understand and create <br>texts. Communication competence
          is developed through linguistic activities (listening, reading, speaking
          <br>and writing). <br>The backbone of language learning consists of thematic
          areas, which are instrumental in developing <br>communication competence
          and its scope. At both stages of study and in every form, themes from all
          <br>thematic areas are covered, but to varied extent and by focusing on
          different aspects. In addressing the <br>themes, the experiences, interests
          and needs of students are taken into account. Activities that require <br>purposeful
          use of the language and integrate different aspects of language proficiency
          play a central role in <br>learning foreign languages. In planning study
          activities, basic didactic principles are followed (from near to <br>far,
          from familiar to unfamiliar, from simple to complex, from concrete to abstract)
          and the needs of <br>language use are taken into account (starting from
          more common words and forms). Pair and group work <br>are essential at both
          stages of study. Students are guided to perform independent tasks appropriate
          to their <br>age (read, find information, participate in projects, etc.).
          <br>In order to develop students’ communication competence and cultural
          awareness, they are encouraged to <br>use the language outside of language
          lessons as well. To increase their motivation, it is advisable to help <br>them
          find pen-friends, organise field trips and student exchanges as well as
          meetings with native speakers <br>of the language they study. <br>It is
          essential to motivate learners at both stages of study and develop their
          positive attitudes towards <br>language learning. In order to experience
          the sense of achievement, a positive atmosphere is created in <br>the classroom
          and all accomplishments of learners are recognised. Efforts made to achieve
          the results <br>need to be acknowledged as well. Mistakes are considered
          normal in language learning process; their <br>analysis facilitates understanding
          and enables the students to correct their language use. <br> <br> <br>15'

            people make in using <br>the language. In studying the themes, attention
            is paid to becoming familiar with cultures and comparing <br>them to the  students’
            native culture by emphasising the uniqueness and value of all cultures.
            Students <br>understand different cultural practices and can take them

            activities, which can be used for developing constituent skills include,
            e.g.: <br>1) listening to and reading different text types appropriate
            to the students’ age; <br>2) independent reading of adapted texts appropriate
            to the students’ age; <br>3) using media and authentic audiovisual materials
            (e.g. news, short films); <br>4) creative writing (e.g. messages, postcards,
            personal letters, poems, notices, short reports); <br>5) project work;
            <br>6) short presentations (e.g. descriptions of pictures, introducing
            one’s hobbies, project reports); <br>7) role plays and communication games;
            and <br>8) finding information in varied reference sources in foreign
            languages (e.g. dictionaries, the Internet).'

        label: 'In accordance with the Development Strategy of the Estonian Language,
          the curriculum sets the goal to <br>reach the B2 language proficiency level
          by the end of basic school. Basic school graduates have achieved <br>good
          learning results in Estonian as a second language, if they have reached
          level B1.2; and very good, if <br>they have reached level B2.1. Learning
          Estonian as a second language in basic school is the basis, which <br>enables
          students to continue their studies in an upper secondary school where the
          language of instruction <br>is Estonian. <br>19 <br> <br>For the majority
          of the students, whose native language is not Estonian, ‘Estonian as a second
          language’ is <br>their first contact with the language and culture of another
          nation. Therefore, it is very important to provoke <br>their interest in
          Estonian language and culture and increase their motivation to learn other
          foreign <br>languages.In addition to studying Estonian, learners’ command
          of the language is also developed through <br>CLIL. <br>Acquiring a foreign
          language as a means of communication is a process requiring continuous effort
          and <br>active involvement of learners. The instruction is based on the
          principles of communicative teaching. The <br>emphasis is on interactive
          learning and practicing the language studied. <br>Communicative proficiency
          of the language (communication competence) includes three components: <br>linguistic,
          sociolinguistic and pragmatic. Knowledge of the language (pronunciations,
          grammar and <br>vocabulary) is not an aim in its own right, but a means
          for achieving better command of the language. The <br>structure of the language
          is studied in context; grammar rules are knowledgeably learned stage-by-stage.
          <br>Through sociolinguistic competence learners develop their ability to
          use the language appropriately in <br>different situations (rules of politeness,
          language registers, etc.). Through pragmatic competence learners <br>improve
          their ability to understand and create texts. Communication competence is
          developed through <br>linguistic activities (listening, reading, speaking
          and writing). <br>The backbone of language learning consists of thematic
          areas, which support the formation and the scope <br>of communication competence.
          In basic schools, the starting point in studying the themes is ‘Me and My
          <br>Surroundings’. At all stages of study and in every form, themes from
          all thematic areas are covered, but to <br>varied extent and by focusing
          on different things. In addressing the themes, the experiences, interests
          and <br>needs of the students at a respective stage of study are taken into
          account. In language lessons, students <br>and teachers mainly communicate
          in Estonian. Explanations may be given in the school’s language of <br>instruction
          if necessary. In the course of studies, students’ learning skills are developed,
          including the skill <br>of setting personal learning goals and analysing
          the results by using for instance the European Language <br>Portfolio or
          a learning portfolio.  <br>In planning study activities, basic didactic
          principles are followed (from near to far, from familiar to <br>unfamiliar,
          from simple to complex, from concrete to abstract) and the needs of language
          use are taken into <br>account (starting from more common words and forms).
          Pair and group work (role plays, acting, <br>brainstorming) are essential
          at all stages of study. Students are increasingly guided to perform independent
          <br>tasks appropriate to their age (read, find information, participate
          in projects). <br>The content learned is integrated with use of the language
          outside of language classes. This can be done <br>through varied activities,
          which take place in the language environment (student exchange, joint activities
          of <br>several schools, field trips, seeking information in varied information
          sources). Language studies are <br>complemented through learners’ personal
          experiences, which they can share with their fellow students. <br>It is
          essential to motivate learners at all stages of study and to foster positive
          attitudes towards language <br>learning. In order to experience a sense
          of achievement, a positive atmosphere is created in the classroom <br>and
          all accomplishments of learners are acknowledged. Efforts made to achieve
          the results are <br>acknowledged as well. Mistakes are considered normal
          in the language learning process; their analysis <br>facilitates understanding
          and enables the students to correct their language use.'

            also in the language environment (e.g. lessons in museums, field trips,
            student <br>exchanges). Students take part in Estonian cultural life more
            than before (e.g. group visits to theatre <br>performances, concerts and

            appropriate to their age. Different forms of shorter and longer creative
            works are <br>used for developing students’ writing skills. <br>Students
            begin to approach language studies analytically; they learn to see the
            similarities and differences <br>between languages and notice mistakes
            that they or other people make in using the language. <br>Students learn
            to understand cultural differences, recognise them and take them into

            culture and society and participate in it. Students learn <br>to value
            diverse ways of thinking, express their opinions and consider different
            views. <br>The activities, which can be used for developing constituent
            skills include, e.g.: <br>24 <br> <br>1) listening to and reading, also

            reviews, simpler research papers; <br>6) oral presentations (e.g. project
