      label: 'Studying mathematics develops not only mathematics competences but also
        all other general <br>competences. <br>Cultural and value competence. Mathematics
        is a science that unifies different cultures. Thus, pupils can <br>learn about
        the works of mathematicians from different countries and eras. Pupils are
        guided to recognise <br>the elegance of logical trains of thought as well
        as the beauty of geometric objects under observation and <br>their relation
        with architecture and nature. Studying mathematics helps to develop such character
        traits as <br>determination, persistence, perseverance, accuracy and attentiveness
        while also teaching to follow <br>discipline. Solving of mathematical problems
        creates interest in the surrounding world and improves <br>understanding of
        the laws of nature. Pupils will learn to notice the connection of mathematics
        to daily life <br>and understand that basic mathematical knowledge improves
        comprehension of other science disciplines. <br>Social and citizenship competence.
        Responsibility towards society and fellow citizens is raised by <br>solving
        tasks with relevant content. Paired and group work tasks enable students to
        develop their <br>cooperation and mutual assistance skills and to increase
        tolerance towards students with different <br>mathematical abilities. <br>Self-management
        competence. In mathematics independent work has an important role to play.
        By <br>means of independent task solving, pupils can assess and develop their
        mathematical abilities. <br>Learning to learn competence. When studying mathematics,
        it is essential to perceive the learning <br>material in depth and understand
        everything. Solving problem tasks develops analytical, rational method <br>finding
        and critical outcome assessment skills. Generalisation and analogy-using skills
        are very important: <br>skills in carrying acquired knowledge over to suitable
        contexts. Pupils are guided towards the <br>understanding that complex tasks
        can only be solved by using independent thought. <br>3 <br> <br>Communication
        competence. Mathematics develops pupils’ ability to express their ideas clearly,
        briefly <br>and precisely. This is primarily the case when formulating hypotheses
        and theorems and also when <br>formulating the task solution. Solving of text
        problems improves the skill of understanding a text: to <br>distinguish between
        important and unimportant parts and seek out relevant information for a given
        quantity. <br>Mathematics has an important role in developing preparedness
        for understanding, associating and <br>communicating information presented
        in different ways (text, graphs, tables, diagrams and formulas). <br>Mathematics
        and natural sciences and technology competence. Mathematics helps to develop
        skills <br>that are required for evidence-based decision-making. It provides
        information on methods and techniques <br>of data processing, measurement,
        comparison, classification and systematisation.  <br>Entrepreneurial competence.
        Entrepreneurial competence is developed by solving problems with real life
        <br>data. Identification of different solution paths improves the flexibility
        of thought and the ability to generate <br>ideas.'

      label: 'Mathematics is integrated with other subject fields in two principal
        ways. Through the use of mathematical <br>methods in other subject fields,
        students develop an understanding of mathematics as a basic science, with
        <br>its universal language and methods, that supports other subject fields.
        The use of problems associated with <br>other subject fields and real life
        provides students with an idea of application opportunities of mathematics.  <br>Language
        and literature, including foreign languages. Education develops the skill
        of clear and relevant <br>oral and written self-expression, creation, interpretation
        and presentation of texts, including tables, graphs, <br>etc. Students are
        guided to use appropriate linguistic resources and mathematical vocabulary
        while <br>observing correct grammar. The solving of text problems helps to
        develop functional reading skills, <br>including the ability to understand
        visual information. Attention is paid to the correct writing of numerals,
        as <br>well as accurate formatting of text, graphs, tables and other information.
        The meaning of mathematical <br>concepts of foreign origin is explained and
        foreign language skills can be developed through the search <br>and use of
        additional resources. <br>Natural sciences. A mathematics teacher can engage
        in close cooperation with teachers of natural <br>sciences. The productivity
        of such cooperation depends, on the one hand, on the mathematics teacher’s
        <br>knowledge of the content of other subject fields and, on the other hand,
        on the abilities and skills of science <br>teachers to use mathematics and
        its language in a reasonable and accurate manner in their subject field. <br>Inquiry
        learning in science subjects requires students to have the ability to analyse
        the data collected <br>through observations and experiments, and to present
        the results of observations and experiments as <br>graphs, diagrams and tables.  <br>Social
        subjects. The solving of problems helps to develop the skill of understanding
        and selecting <br>information: to differentiate between important and unimportant
        parts and to identify (in a text, on a drawing, <br>etc.) data required for
        solving a problem. The formatting of solutions to problems and formulation
        of <br>hypotheses and theorems helps to develop the skill of clear, concise
        and accurate expression of thoughts. <br>Information on mathematical concepts
        can be combined with the provision of information on important <br>social
        topics, such as population structure and the shares of different social groups,
        individual and state <br>budget, wages and taxes, interest, interest on arrears,
        the risks associated with rapid loans, the use of pro <br>mille and percentage
        point units in daily life, etc. Data from the social sphere is used in the
        context of <br>4 <br> <br>mathematical topics associated with statistics.
        Students learn how to use different information <br>environments (for instance,
        assess the accuracy of media-published diagrams based on what they have <br>learned)
        and gain an overview of the current taxation system. Logical reasoning and
        factual thinking enable <br>people to make right decisions in life. Practical
        assignments, group work tasks and participation in projects <br>improve cooperation,
        mutual support and respect for each other. <br>Art subjects. Art and geometry
        (technical drawing, measurement) are closely interconnected. The <br>development
        of art competence can be supported with resources that demonstrate geometry
        applications <br>in art fields, such as architecture, interior design, ornamental
        art, design, etc. Geometric concepts can be <br>used as a basis for analysing
        objects in art education. Classification of important characteristics of shapes
        <br>and use of symbols are integral elements of art together with comparison
        and classification of properties of <br>depicted objects/phenomena. As a result
        of integration, students will develop the ability to see the beauty of <br>graphs
        drawn in computer software, to notice the beauty of different geometrical
        shapes in their home <br>environment and in the nature, to calculate the area
        and volume of familiar shapes if necessary. <br>In music, intervals, measures
        and note durations are usually expressed as common fractions. <br>Technology.
        The classes of handicraft and home economics, crafts and technology studies
        involve <br>practical measurements and calculations, reading and creation
        of drawings, etc., in connection with <br>designing and creating projects.
        <br>Physical education. The skill to interpret numerical data is expressed
        in the ability to compare sports <br>results and understand the information
        presented in ranking tables. Text problems are used to explain the <br>importance
        of healthy lifestyle, physical activity and sports for human health, as well
        as the importance <br>medical achievements. Students can use objective numerical
        data to assess their health behaviour, for <br>instance, the quantity of sugar
        in food, traffic behaviour (speed, braking distance, visibility), etc. Physical
        <br>activity and movement contribute to understanding the basic concepts of
        units and measurement systems. <br>One type of mathematical models of reality,
        namely maps, are used in physical education classes to learn <br>navigation.
        Consistency, accuracy and the ability to identify the simplest and best solution
        are integral parts <br>of both mathematics and sports.'

      label: The cross-curricular topics introduced in the general part of the curriculum
        are primarily realised in basic <br>school mathematics lessons by systematically
        organising studying activities and giving references to <br>relevant subjects
        under observation.  <br>Lifelong learning and career planning. Mathematics
        education communicates the need to learn and <br>helps to develop independent
        study skills. Mathematics lessons shape the ability to think in an abstract
        and <br>logical manner. Realistic assessment of one’s abilities is one of
        the most important preconditions of career <br>planning. Students are guided
        towards developing their studying, communication, cooperation, decision <br>making
        and information handling skills. Educational activities offer opportunities
        for direct contacts with the <br>world of employment, e.g., through visits
        to undertakings, presentations of occupations and professions <br>related
        to the subject field. <br>Environment and sustainable development. Actual
        data regarding the use of environmental resources <br>can be used in mathematics
        problems. When analysing this data, pupils are encouraged to develop a <br>5
        <br> <br>sustainable attitude towards their surroundings and taught to value
        the physical and social environment. <br>Outdoor lessons are possible. Pupils
        learn to take personal responsibility for a sustainable future and <br>achieve
        appropriate values and behaviour models. The perspectives of environmental
        and human <br>development are assessed based on facts. When handling this
        particular topic, descriptive mathematics <br>related to percentage calculation,
        elements of statistics and change and relation. <br>Citizens’ initiative and
        entrepreneurship. Preparation for cooperation and tolerance towards other
        <br>people’s actions and opinions are developed through cooperative activities
        (research, group work, projects) <br>that integrate mathematics and other
        subjects. The percentage calculation and elements of statistics <br>enable
        the pupils to understand the meaning of numerical data used to describe society
        and its <br>development. <br>Cultural identity. Mathematics is a part of both
        global and national culture. A modern living environment <br>could not exist
        without mathematics. This can be emphasised by presenting the history of mathematics,
        the <br>connections between the development of society and mathematical research,
        etc. By means of percentage <br>calculation and statistics, pupils are able
        to describe the processes occurring in society in relation to the <br>topic
        of the multicultural world (different nations, different religions, different
        social positions in society etc.). <br>Information environment. The information
        environment is associated with the skill to present and <br>understand information
        in different formats (drawing, image, formula, model). An adequate perception
        of <br>media manipulations is supported by the problems presented in the mathematics
        course, making use of <br>statistical procedures and percentage calculations.
        Students are guided towards critical analysis of <br>information.  <br>Technology
        and innovation. Technological processes and modelling are presented through
        integration of <br>the mathematics course with technology and natural science
        subjects. When planning and implementing <br>their activities and assessing
        the final results, students perform measurements and calculations and use
        <br>ICT tools for studying and increasing the efficiency of their work. Various
        educational software applications <br>can be used in mathematics education.
        <br>Technology and innovation. By solving problems students learn how to use
        technological tools and <br>understand the importance of mathematics for scientific
        and technological development.   <br>Health and safety. Mathematics education
        can include problems containing health and safety data (e.g., <br>text problems
        related to the traffic environment, movement of road users and vehicles; other
        problems and <br>graphs presenting data on risk factors). <br>Values and morality.
        Study of mathematics is accomplishable if students develop their systematic
        <br>approach, consistency, persistence, accuracy, correctness and sense of
        responsibility. The example of the <br>teacher facilitates development of
        a tolerant attitude towards other students with different abilities. Studying
        <br>and teaching mathematics should offer students as many positive emotions
        as possible.
