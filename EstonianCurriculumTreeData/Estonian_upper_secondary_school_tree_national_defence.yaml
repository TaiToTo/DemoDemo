      label: 'The optional course of national defence intends to make the students
        aware of their national defence-<br>related duties and rights arising from
        the Constitution, combined with a concept of the types of military <br>service
        in the Defence Forces. The course is meant to give theoretical knowledge in
        the sphere of national <br>defence, which shall then be enforced by practical
        exercises. The goals of the optional course are to lay the <br>foundations
        for the students’ understanding of the principles of national defence of Estonia
        and to shape <br>the students’ civic awareness and readiness to defend Estonia
        if necessary. <br>  <br>To avoid overloading the students, some subjects are
        discussed in-depth, while others are only touched <br>upon, as the course
        is taught.  <br>  <br>2 <br> <br>National defence is an optional course of
        two sub-courses totalling 70 hours. The first course (35 hours) is <br>the
        theoretical part and the second course (also 35 hours) involves practical
        training (whenever possible, at <br>a training centre or military field camp).
        Practical exercises, including the time spent at the military field <br>camp,
        are subject to the completion of the corresponding sections of the theoretical
        course. The school <br>shall organise the teaching of the national defence
        course based on its resources, either by integrating the <br>theoretical and
        practical parts or as two separate courses. Theoretical and practical studies
        are integrated <br>in the syllabus by study topic.  <br>  <br>The theoretical
        part of the national defence course starts with an overview of Estonian military
        history and <br>the genesis, causes and consequences of wars. The students
        are provided an overview of modern threats, <br>crises and armed conflicts
        review, as well as international law, including military justice. The theoretical
        <br>course provides basic knowledge about the national defence of Estonia,
        command of national defence and <br>its objectives, the structure of the Defence
        Forces and the Defence League, security and defence politics, <br>and military
        service. The students will learn about the evolvement and use of different
        military formations, <br>the development of different types of weapons, their
        historical meaning and usefulness today, and will <br>become familiar with
        different types of weapons. Civil protection and first aid topics are studied
        and the <br>students will learn to cope in the natural environment without
        resources. The course also includes an <br>element of topography, involving
        understanding one’s bearings on a terrain, using chart and compass for <br>assistance,
        how the activities of armed forces may affect the environment, and how these
        adverse effects <br>can be alleviated.  <br>  <br>The practical course focuses
        on practising individual skills in different situations. In firearms training,
        the <br>students shall initially learn about safety measures and the factors
        that influence firing, and then proceed <br>with firing techniques and practise
        firing stances. Firearms training is concluded with practical firing <br>exercises.
        Drill training includes the practising of positions of attention, manoeuvres,
        various types of <br>tactical movement, including the movement on terrain,
        and different types of a march. In topographic <br>practice, the students
        learn to use topographic charts, scale of degrees and symbols of charts and
        to <br>acquire their azimuth, using a compass. Separate exercises are dedicated
        to orientation with a compass <br>and chart and other positioning solutions.
        Practical first aid includes learning the sequence of actions at an <br>accident
        site and life-sustaining (protection of life) and enhanced first aid techniques.
        <br> <br>Depending on the resources available to schools, it is recommended
        to organise practical studies for the <br>course participants, involving either
        a single or double stage military field camp. One stage option is a three
        <br>or four day camp, organised at the end of each school year, while the
        second option involves two one and <br>a half or two day camps, held in winter
        and spring, respectively. Such military field camps are organised, if <br>possible,
        involving the regional units and/or the Defence Forces; attempts are made
        to concentrate the <br>camps to include the national defence course students
        of several schools. <br> <br>The upper secondary school’s military field camp
        of national defence is designed for students to acquire <br>practical experience
        on the basis of the theoretical course topics on the level of single combatant
        skills. The <br>students comprehend the skills of single combatants through
        exercises that enable them to act efficiently in <br>crisis situations. As
        a result, students will be more self-confident when performing functions related
        to <br>national defence. <br> <br>The students that are participating in a
        camp are divided into squad-based groups with assigned squad <br>leaders.
        If possible, previously issued uniforms should be worn. It is recommended
        to organise the two-day <br>camp on a Friday and Saturday. <br>3 <br> <br>Opportunities
        for Integration with Other Subjects <br> <br>The optional course of national
        defence is multidisciplinary and has solid points of contact with several
        <br>school subjects: <br>1) history – military history, causes and consequences
        of crises and conflicts, international crises and <br>conflicts, NATO and
        the United Nations; <br>2) biology – human anatomy and physiology, weapons
        of mass destruction, civil defence and <br>environmental protection; <br>3)
        Estonian language – terminology, work with legal texts and skills of oral
        and written self-<br>expression; <br>4) physics – ballistics, weapons of mass
        destruction and civil defence; <br>5) geography – cartography; <br>6) chemistry
        – weapons of mass destruction, civil defence and safety requirements; <br>7)
        physical education – general physical activities and stamina; <br>8) mathematics
        – chart scale calculation, degree calculation, use of information technology
        and <br>communication (hereinafter: ITC); <br>9) foreign languages – terminology;  <br>10)
        social studies – civics, organisation of national defence, structure of the
        Defence Forces and the <br>Defence League, NATO and the UN, international
        crises and conflicts, and Estonian defence <br>policy.'

        attained <br>and individual student development and using the information
        obtained to plan more effective studies. The <br>aspects that are assessed
        include the students’ knowledge, their skills in implementing this knowledge
        and <br>their acquisition of general competences, including learning skills
        on the basis of oral answers <br>(presentations), written and/or practical
        work and practical activities, taking into account how the knowledge <br>and
        skills of the students comply with the learning outcomes stipulated in the
        optional course syllabus. <br> <br>The learning outcomes are assessed using
        oral appraisal and numerical grades. The students must know <br>what is being
        assessed and when, what means are being used for assessment, and what the
        assessment <br>criteria are. <br> <br>The forms of verifying the learning

        compilation of <br>abstracts and research papers, writing of opinion pieces
        and case analysis. Both theoretical and practical <br>course parts are assessed,

        for fellow students in joint <br>activities and group work i.e. civic participation.
        <br> <br>When compiling assignments to verify students achievements, the teacher
        must incorporate tasks of <br>different levels: verifying of knowledge (concepts,

        in new situations); comprehension (description, explanation and paraphrasing);
        analysis <br>and synthesis (indication of connections, comparison, grouping,
        discernment and connection of facts with <br>regularities); and assessment
        (drawing conclusions and making decisions). Practical achievements are <br>5
