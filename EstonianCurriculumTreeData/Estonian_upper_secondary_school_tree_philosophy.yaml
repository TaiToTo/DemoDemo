      label: 'In the first philosophy course, ‘Introduction to Philosophical Thought’,
        the emphasis is on practicing <br>philosophical reasoning modes. The second
        course, ‘Questions of Modern Philosophy’, reinforces the basic <br>skills
        acquired during the first course, paying attention to the philosophical approach
        to ways of knowing, <br>values, society and environment. Passing the first
        course is a requirement for participating in the second <br>course because
        it is assumed that the student will have basic skills in philosophical thinking.
        <br> <br>The main focus of Philosophy is to examine discussion topics about
        philosophical questions through tools <br>of philosophical thinking and, in
        the course of this, give an overview of philosophy as a field of study. The
        <br>course consists of three main areas:  <br>1) philosophy as a field of
        study;  <br>2) philosophical thinking; and  <br>3) discussion topics about
        philosophical questions.  <br>These main areas take up about the same amount
        of time in the course. <br>In the framework of philosophy studies, the concepts,
        areas, branches and history of philosophy and <br>philosophy’s role in the
        sciences are discussed. The techniques of philosophy are practised through
        their <br>correct application in spoken and written form. The discussion topics
        include philosophical questions about <br>ways of knowing, values, society
        and environment. The course is based on findings from the academic field <br>of
        research in philosophy, which are presented in a simplified and didactic way
        in the form that is most <br>useful.  <br>The discussion topics are integrated
        with specific knowledge of other subjects and with students’ general <br>2
        <br> <br>experience of knowledge. When discussing values, studies are integrated
        with subjects that involve ethical <br>issues and ethical questions concerning
        students. When discussing society and the environment, studies <br>are integrated
        primarily with social and nature subjects, as well as with locally relevant
        issues of the living <br>environment.  <br>Examining the topics specific to
        the area of study is not a goal in itself for the subject but the main <br>emphasis
        is on preparing for the discussion topics of courses and acquiring the general
        intellectual <br>background necessary for studying philosophy. Students study
        the concepts and approaches that are <br>necessary for discussing the philosophical
        questions of the discussion topics and which are important for <br>understanding
        the meaning of the area of study. <br>In the framework of the topics specific
        to the area of study, primary knowledge is acquired about the <br>periods
        of history of philosophy and the lines of thought that characterize them.
        Studying the history of <br>philosophy through lines of thought means focusing
        on the thoughts characteristic of certain periods, how <br>they changed and
        what their role in the history of philosophy was. <br>The discussion of the
        subject field of philosophy is integrated with appropriate topics from other
        subjects, <br>establishing associations with philosophical topics and other
        areas of science and life. The study of <br>philosophical thought is integrated
        with subjects that promote development of spoken and/or written <br>reasoning
        and self-expression skills. Philosophical thought shares important elements
        with the modes of <br>reasoning in sciences, as well as with general self-expression
        skills taught in linguistic subjects. <br> <br>Philosophical reasoning. The
        central role of reasoning is a specific trait of philosophy studies. <br>Consequently,
        spoken and written exercises to practice philosophical reasoning are an essential
        part of this <br>subject. Philosophical reasoning is practiced in spoken and
        written reflection through argumentation and <br>interpretation. The aim is
        to learn how to apply reasoning techniques in a correct manner in free <br>philosophical
        reflection and when working with philosophical texts. The modes of philosophical
        reasoning <br>can be learned through the study of basic terminology and practical
        techniques of reasoning.  <br>Good practice is expressed in an appropriate
        attitude towards philosophical discussion, including a serious <br>attitude
        towards arguments and a respectful attitude towards those who present them,
        respecting the <br>reader and the listener, expressing the thoughts in an
        understandable way and being open to discussion <br>and critique. The principal
        endeavour of philosophical discussion is thinking about concepts and ideas.
        In <br>thinking about them the aim is to use arguments according to different
        philosophical premises and <br>approaches. In discussions about philosophical
        viewpoints students must not merely express opinions: <br>their opinions must
        always be based on something and they should be ready to give reasons for
        them. <br>Elementary techniques of critical thinking and philosophical interpretation
        are used. <br>Topics for reflection on philosophical issues. The main part
        of the subject is focused on elaboration of <br>philosophical issues, included
        in the subject syllabus, using methods of philosophical reasoning. <br>Philosophical
        questions are based on modes of knowledge, values and social and environmental
        <br>sustainability. The study of reasoning consists of theoretical and practical
        parts. The theoretical part entails <br>a gradual presentation of the concepts
        and approaches required for discussion of different topics. Previous <br>experiences
        of students are taken into account when selecting and elaborating on specific
        questions for <br>reflection.'

      label: Assessment is based on respective provisions of the general part of the
        national curriculum for upper <br>secondary schools. Detailed assessment procedures
        are specified in the school curriculum. The main <br>purpose of assessment
        is to support students’ development in shaping a positive self-concept and
        <br>adequate self-assessment, with students’ role in assessment recognised
        as being important by providing <br>opportunities for self-assessment. Diverse
        forms of testing and assessment of learning outcomes should be <br>used. The
        objective of testing and assessing learning outcomes is to receive an overview
        of the level of <br>attainment of learning outcomes and development of students
        in the subject, and to use this information for <br>more productive planning
        of studies. Students have to be informed about what and when is going to be
        <br>assessed, which assessment tools and criteria will be used. Diverse forms
        of verifying and assessing <br>learning outcomes should be used. <br>In philosophy,
        assessment focuses on the specific skills that are developed particularly
        though <br>philosophical studies, i.e., understanding and developing philosophical
        reasoning, applying different modes <br>of philosophical reasoning, explaining
        the meaning of philosophical concepts and using them in context. <br>The assignments
        to be assessed are designed to develop creativity and independent reasoning,
        but require <br>systematic use of philosophical concepts and reasoning techniques.
        Formative assessment plays an <br>important role in philosophy due to the
        need to provide feedback on the reasoning modes. Summarising <br>grading is
        secondary in philosophical studies and is suitable only for establishment
        of an adequate level of <br>attainment. Using an assignment to write an essay
        is advisable as a form of assessment. The essays <br>should be prepared in
        stages to enable combining methods of formative assessment and summarising
        <br>grading. When reviewing essays, assessment should focus on reflection
        skills, while mastery and originality <br>of writing are of secondary importance.
        Compliance with basic rules of native language orthography and <br>composition
        is a strict requirement for philosophical essays. <br> <br> <br> <br>4
