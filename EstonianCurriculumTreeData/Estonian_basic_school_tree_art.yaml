      label: 'The subjects in the subject field of art subjects in basic school are
        united in the attention given to <br>developing creativity and the skill of
        self-expression and shaping an integral perception of the world. <br>Involvement
        in arts provides knowledge of different means of expression and cultures,
        and the students <br>learn to understand themselves and the role of arts in
        society. <br>Through the creation, presentation, interpretation and analysis
        of works of art the students learn about <br>traditional and contemporary
        arts and their content, form and meaning, and comprehension and critical <br>approaches
        are developed. Education develops flexible thinking and an open mind towards
        cultural and <br>individual differences that support the ability to navigate
        the rapidly changing and multicultural world. <br>Practical involvement in
        arts develops emotional sphere and intuitive and creative thinking. Art serves
        as an <br>important hobby that enriches our daily lives and helps us attain
        emotional balance. Art activities <br>counterbalance the predominantly verbal
        and analytical thinking fostered by other subjects, adding a <br>figurative,
        synthesising and intuitive side to the thought process. This results in integral
        thinking that <br>facilitates creative approaches to problems, acknowledge
        different solutions and multi-faceted outcomes. <br>Involvement in the arts
        positively influences studies of all school subjects. <br> <br>The art subjects
        have the following common aspects of content, activities and aspirations:
        <br>1) knowledge of arts (analysis); <br>2) connections between the arts (synthesis);
        <br>3) subject-specific (verbal) language; <br>4) creative self-expression
        (creation and presentation); <br>5) appreciation of works of art (communication
        and criticism); <br>6) valuing one’s own, local and global culture (multiculturalism);
        and <br>7) protection of cultural values (sustainability). <br> <br>Choices
        about discussing the learning contents are made by the subject teacher, considering

      label: The field of arts enables natural integration of all general competences
        in daily studies, both theoretically <br>and practically. The teacher plays
        a crucial role in shaping the four interconnected components of <br>competences
        – knowledge, skills, values and attitudes – with the teacher’s values and
        self-assertion skills <br>creating a suitable learning environment and influencing
        students’ values and behaviour. Cooperation <br>between school and home is
        important for the development of general competences. <br>Cultural and value
        competence. The subjects  of field of arts stress the importance of cultural
        knowledge <br>and the cultural space based on common cultural heritage as
        part of our identity. Individual and cultural <br>diversity are valued in
        activities. The topics reviewed, and the works of art and art events analysed
        support <br>the formation of ethical and aesthetic value judgements. Practical
        creative activities and discussions on <br>them teach the students to regard
        arts and music as a means of self-expression, appreciate different ideas,
        <br>viewpoints and problem solutions and respect authorship. Knowledgeable
        and critical attitudes to all <br>information sources are fostered. <br>Social
        and citizenship competence. Investigative assignments, practical group works,
        creative works, <br>discussions, presentations, joint music making and collaborative
        art projects, and participation in field-<br>specific and inter-field study
        projects are the components of the art subjects that develop students’ <br>readiness
        for cooperation and high regard for mutual support. Participation in cultural
        events facilitates the <br>formation of a feeling of cultural togetherness.
        By discussing works of art the students practise defending <br>their points
        of view and learn to respect the opinions of others. The art subjects acknowledge
        the role of the <br>human being as a maker and a user of the environment,
        and direct the students to act with awareness and <br>sustainability both
        in nature and in real and virtual man-made environments. <br>Self-awareness
        competence. Regular feedback and development of self-analysis skills self-analysis
        help <br>the students recognize their own interests and abilities and achieve
        positive self-esteem. Treatment of <br>cultural and social topics (cultural
        phenomena observed, subject matter and messages of works of art and <br>pieces
        of music, etc.) facilitates the formation of the students’ personal, social
        and cultural identities.  <br>Learning to learn competence. The development
        of learning to learn competence of the students is <br>supported through art
        subjects by applying various assignments, study methods and forms of work,
        <br>allowing the students to recognize and utilize their own style of learning.
        Individual and collaborative <br>investigative and problem-based assignments
        require collection of information, its analysis and <br>interpretation and
        application of previously acquired knowledge in novel situations. In art subjects
        the <br>students can themselves create feasible assignments, check the suitability
        of their choices, try new skills <br>and practise consistently. Regular feedback
        and self-analysis help increase the students’ ability of <br>managing their
        own studies. <br>Communication competence. An important part of art subjects
        is talking about works of art, <br>corresponding styles, eras, etc, using
        both correct language and subject-specific terminology in the <br>description.
        The students’ presentations of work and comparison and defence of different
        viewpoints in <br>discussions serve to support the development of the skill
        of self-expression and the use of subject-specific <br>terminology. Writing
        of reviews and creative works in art and music subjects requires an understanding
        of <br>information-source texts and stimulates the use of various methods
        of presenting information (text, <br>drawings, schemes, tables and charts).
        The art subjects introduce art and music as a means of <br>communication –
        the students learn the corresponding non-verbal language and how to ‘translate’
        artistic <br>messages into the verbal variety and vice versa. <br>Mathematics
        and natural sciences and technology competence. Completion of assignments
        in art <br>subjects requires formulation of problems, reflection on solution
        ideas, justification of options and analysis <br>of results. Students learn
        to use art concepts (composition, structure, rhythm, etc.), compare and classify
        <br>the attributes of different art phenomena and use symbols. Art terminology
        includes vocabulary elements <br>and concepts of mathematics and technology.
        By completing creative assignments, students learn how to <br>use technological
        tools and innovative solutions, understand the role of science and technology
        in the <br>development of music and art.  <br>Entrepreneurial competence.
        The development of enterprising skills via art subjects is supported by <br>individual
        and group work, investigative and problem-based assignments and connecting
        the knowledge <br>acquired with contemporary phenomena from daily life Practical
        creative activities offer opportunities to <br>experiment with different ways
        of expressing and presenting one’s ideas as the students inventively select
        <br>suitable methods and make use of their personal strengths. The students
        learn to plan their work and <br>analyse ,assume responsibility for its completion
        and results. The students also learn about professions <br>and institutions
        related to arts.

        label: Interdisciplinarity is a trait inherent of contemporary culture. Art
          subjects are closely connected to all fields <br>of human activity and the
          manners of thought of corresponding eras. Art subjects encompass such topics
          <br>as being human, social relations and our world in its various manifestations.
          It is therefore natural that art <br>subjects have ties with other subject
          fields and there are lots of possibilities of creating connections <br>between
          art subjects and other subject fields. <br>Different cultures are presented
          in many subjects of other fields (language and literature, foreign <br>languages,
          history, civics and citizenship education, geography, handicraft and technology,
          physical <br>education), supporting the development of values and awareness
          of cultural diversity of the world. <br>Compared to other subjects, art
          subjects have a more specific focus on elaborating on intercultural <br>dialogue
          and using creativity as a source of innovation in modern society. <br>Several
          subject fields – language and literature, mathematics, technology, physical
          education – use <br>concepts that overlap with the concepts of art subjects
          (e.g., composition, structure, dimensions, angles, <br>geometric shapes,
          rhythm, plan, style, variation, improvisation, movement, dynamics, etc.).  <br>Subjects
          of the art field rely on knowledge acquired in other subjects, while deepening
          and visualising this <br>knowledge. Practical activities contribute to the
          development of the understanding that knowledge and <br>competences are
          mutually connected and applicable in everyday life. Study projects that
          cross the <br>boundaries of subject fields facilitate integration of art
          subjects with other subject fields and development of <br>competences. <br>Language
          and literature, including foreign languages. Education develops oral and
          written self-<br>expression skills, articulation, functional reading skills
          and the skill to use information channels, and <br>examines the stories
          of different eras and cultures in music and art, theatre and film.  <br>Math.
          Education develops associative skills and logical thinking (mathematical
          language, structure, <br>symbols and methods), as well as knowledge of mathematical
          symbols, shapes and concepts.  <br>Natural sciences. Education creates awareness
          of the physiological characteristics of human senses of <br>hearing and
          sight, provides information on the natural environment and the diversity
          of its organisms, as <br>well as the properties of sound, light and colours.  <br>Social
          subjects. Students examine relations with other human beings and groups
          of people, as well as <br>with customs and traditions of different cultures,
          the roles and changes of art and culture in different <br>historical periods.  <br>Technology.
          Education develops manual skills and creative thinking, the ability of innovative
          generation <br>and practical implementation of ideas (creative process,
          technologies and techniques).  <br>Physical education. Education develops
          bodily sensibility, attention, motor skills, reaction speed and <br>coordination.

        outcomes and contents for the subject of the field, based on the <br>study
        stage and the specific nature of the particular subject. <br>Lifelong learning
        and career planning. Education develops independent learning and acting skills
        as a <br>crucial foundation of lifelong learning habits and attitudes. Different
        forms of study are used to develop <br>students’ communication and cooperation
        skills, which are important for future employment. Art and music <br>enable
        students to acknowledge their abilities and interests, to acquire subject-specific
        and general thinking <br>and acting strategies. Students examine the diverse
        expressions of arts in daily life, the professions and <br>occupations related
        to arts, and can have direct experiences with the world of employment, e.g.,
        by visiting <br>creative undertakings. Students learn about occupations and

        artificial <br>environment as a source of creativity and acquire environmental
        protection skills. Education places a high <br>value on cultural heritage
        and sustainable development of natural culture. It emphasises the skill to
        identify <br>recycling opportunities and to analyse the objects of an artificial
        environment from ecological, aesthetical <br>and ethical perspectives. <br>Citizens’

        who <br>can successfully navigate the constantly changing technological living,
        learning and working environment.  <br>Health and safety. Art subjects raise
        awareness of the emotionally balancing effect of art practice. The <br>practice
        of fine arts is associated with the use of materials, tools and instruments
        that require adherence to <br>the principles of safety and expediency.   <br>Values
        and morality. Values and morality. The learning contents and study activities
        present local, <br>Estonian and global cultural heritage, raise awareness
        of the role of culture in everyday life, and support <br>development of heritage
        culture in the modern globalising world. Education contributes to the formation
        of <br>an open and respectful attitude towards different cultural traditions
        and modern cultural phenomena. It <br>places value on creative expressions
        of new ideas, personal experiences and emotions. Students are <br>guided to

        with the provisions of the general part of the national curriculum for basic
        schools and the <br>learning outcomes specified in the national curriculum
        for basic schools. Assessment criteria and any <br>assessment procedures that
        deviate from the five-grade system are specified in the school curriculum.
        <br>The objective of assessment in art subjects is to support students development,
        encourage students to find <br>original ideas and creative solutions and direct
        them towards purposeful learning; to guide the development <br>of students’
        self esteem, to arouse interest in music, art and culture, and to lay a foundation
        for a lifelong <br>practice of music and art; to guide and support students
        in choosing an education path in the field of arts. <br>Assessment provides
        feedback on students’ individual development and constitutes the basis for
        the <br>planning of subsequent studies. <br>Assessment is based on the required
        competences of the subject field, focusing on the following: <br>1) development
        of students’ musical and artistic abilities; <br>2) application of knowledge
        and skills in musical performances and artistic creations; <br>3) original
        approach to creative assignments. <br>Assessment values students’ theoretical

        to implement the results. It is important in assessment to recognise the diversity
        of solutions and <br>individuality of students. <br>The forms of assessing
        the learning outcomes should be diverse, they should motivate students’ <br>development
        and correspond to their learning outcomes. Learning outcomes are assessed
        with numerical <br>grades and oral assessments. Numerical grades are supplemented
        by oral feedback. Students have to be <br>informed about what and when is
        going to be assessed and which assessment criteria will be used in case <br>of
        both oral assessments and numerical grades. The teacher’s verbal assessments
        and numerical grades <br>should motivate students’ development in the field
        of arts. <br>Both formative assessment and summarising grading are used in
        assessment, depending on the <br>established learning objective and the contents
        and goals of the curriculum. <br>When assessing written assignments, teachers
        primarily take into account the content but also correct <br>spelling mistakes.
        <br>In arts education, assessment of students is based on the following outcomes,

        label: 'The subject of music supports the development of the students’ individual
          distinctive features through <br>musical self-expression. Musical education
          contributes to the formation of wholesome individuals, <br>balancing and
          supporting students’ emotional development, incl. in the study of other
          subjects.  <br> <br>Music is taught to open up and broaden the scope of
          opportunities for involvement in and enjoyment of <br>music. The emergence
          of lifelong musical hobbies is supported. By introducing Estonian and global
          musical <br>culture to the students their musical taste and socio-cultural
          value judgments are shaped. <br> <br>The music subject syllabus was compiled
          on the basis of the following principles: <br>1) to understand and respect
          the important role of singing together in the national cultural tradition;
          <br>2) to stress the relative importance of making music; <br>3) to encourage
          and support creative self-expression; <br>4) to understand and reinforce
          the personal student-music relationship; <br>5) to stress the role of music
          in the shaping of ethical and aesthetic value judgments for a balanced <br>personality
          and developing and enriching sensory and intellectual perception; and <br>6)
          to teach in accordance with the needs of the learner and to attach importance
          to integrated <br>activities. <br> <br>Music is taught on the basis of the
          traditions and principles developed in the Estonian school music subject
          <br>(by Riho Päts and Heino Kaljuste) that rely on the adapted approach
          to the Zoltán Kodály method and Carl <br>Orff’s pedagogy coupled with modern
          educational knowledge and experience. <br>The constituent elements of musical
          education include musical performance (singing, playing an <br>instrument),
          movement to music, original creation, listening to music and music history,
          musical literacy, <br>and study visits. <br>Music contributes to the formation
          and development of the following constituent skills in students:  <br>1)
          singing; <br>2) playing musical instruments; <br>3) musical movement; <br>4)
          composing; and <br>5) listening to music and musicology. <br> <br>The elements
          and constituent skills of the subject have multi-faceted and close mutual
          connections and <br>they are developed through musical activities.  <br>Making
          music in this context is any form of musical self-expression, such as singing,
          playing musical <br>instruments, movement or students’ own creations. Music
          play develops the students’ individuality, as they <br>acquire skills and
          knowledge for individual and collective music play and creative self-expression.
          Studying <br>in groups and alone, the students develop their skills of communication,
          cooperation and listening to each <br> <br>10<br>other, and a feeling of
          togetherness, tolerance, flexibility and emotional competence. The self-esteem
          and <br>learning motivation of the students are guided accordingly. Joint
          and choral singing develops social skills <br>and fosters love among the
          students for their fatherland. <br>Original creation is associated with
          simple accompaniments, rhythmic/melodic improvisations, movement to <br>music
          and creation of lyrics. <br> <br>Listening to music develops listening skills,
          attention, analytical capabilities and skills in comparison. <br>Musicology
          introduces different composers, characters, means of expression, styles
          and interpretations.  <br> <br>Musical literacy means skills in reading
          the musical notation included in the syllabus while making music. <br>Study
          visits (incl. virtual visits) to concert venues, theatres and museums contribute
          to expanding students’ <br>horizons and formation of musical tastes, knowledge
          of local, national and European cultural heritage and <br>its role in the
          world, as well as the main cultural achievements (incl. pop culture).  <br>Organisation
          of concerts at school is an integral part of musical education, enabling
          students to develop a <br>habit of listening to music and to have an experience
          of organising an event together.'

          Outcomes <br>The students: <br>1) describe their new musical experience
          and share their opinions about it orally or otherwise <br>creatively; and
          <br>2) express their opinions using the musical terminology they have learned.
          <br> <br>Learning Content in the 1st stage of study <br> <br>1st Stage of
          Study focuses on singing and playing musical instruments. Singing in unison
          is practised both a <br>cappella and with accompaniment. In this age group
          the school builds the foundation for the preservation <br>and propagation
          of musical traditions and one of the outputs here is participation of all
          students in the <br>school choir in order to acquire the basic choral singing
          experience. The students acquire the initial <br>techniques of playing different
          rhythm instruments (including body percussion) and xylophones, as well as
          <br>the 6-string smaller zither or the  recorder. Musical instruments are
          predominantly played to accompany <br>singing. Musical movement is significant:
          folk dances and singing games and expression of the characters <br>of a
          particular piece of music through movement. Musical thinking and creativity
          are developed through <br>accompaniment, rhythmic and melodic improvisation
          and text creation, including the  composing. By <br>listening to music the
          students learn to understand its characters and moods and to depict the
          pieces of <br>music they have listened to.  <br>The foundations of musical
          literacy are acquired through musical activities and they are then applied
          to <br>various musical activities. The performance skills of the students
          are developed both during the lessons of <br>music and beyond them and outside
          of the school (choirs, soloists, different groups of players of musical
          <br>instruments, etc.).  <br> <br>13<br>In order to offer the students a
          diverse musical listening experience, shape their concert attendance culture
          <br>and expand their horizons the students are offered opportunities to
          attend concerts and theatrical plays <br>both hosted by the school and organised
          elsewhere.  <br>By assessing themselves and their classmates, the students
          learn to mutually understand their abilities, <br>skills and peculiarities.'

          diesis, flat, natural and parallel tonalities; <br> vocal music, solo singing,
          choir singing, instrumental music, performer and improvisation; <br> timbre,
          types of singing voice (soprano, mezzo-soprano, alto, tenor, baritone and
          bass) and groups <br>of musical instruments (keyboard, string, wind and
          percussion instruments and Estonian folk <br>instruments); and <br> tempo,

          forte, <br>mezzopiano, mezzoforte, pianissimo, fortissimo, crescendo and
          diminuendo.  <br> <br>Educational Outings <br>Learning Outcomes <br>The
          students: <br>1) share and discuss their opinions about musical experience
          orally, in writing or in another creative <br>manner; and <br>2) express
          their opinions using the musical terminology they have learned. <br> <br>Learning
          Content in the 2nd stage of study <br> <br>At this stage of study the work
          aimed at developing the students’ individual musical abilities and <br>implementing
          them in different musical activities acquires significance. The important
          constituent skills at <br>this stage are once again singing and playing
          musical instruments. During classroom lessons the students <br>sing a cappella
          and with accompaniment in one and two voices; in the school choir they sing
          in two and <br>three voices. The skills of playing musical instruments in
          different groups of players of musical instruments <br>are improved and
          the techniques of playing the 6-string smaller zither or the  recorder are
          further <br>developed.  <br> <br>In movement activities the main stress
          is on Estonian folk dances and expression of the character of music <br>of
          other peoples through movement. Musical thinking and creativity are developed
          through  composing. <br>Listening to music further develops musical analytical
          capability and skills of comparison. It is important to <br>use specific
          musical terminology when expressing and justifying personal opinions. If
          possible, students <br>should listen to the works of local composers and
          musicians.  <br>Musical literacy is acquired through constituent musical
          skills and it is applied in various musical activities.  <br> <br>16<br>The
          self-expression skills of the students are developed both during lessons
          and beyond them, including <br>outside of the school (choirs, soloists,
          different groups of players of musical instruments, etc.).  <br>In order
          to offer the students a proper musical listening experience, shape their
          concert attendance culture <br>and expand their horizons, the students attend
          concerts and other musical performances and also go on <br>various educational
          outings.  <br>By assessing themselves and their classmates, the students
          learn to mutually understand their abilities, <br>skills and peculiarities.'

          <br> <br>The attention at the 3rd Stage of Study is focused on further development
          of the students’ independent <br>musical thinking and musical skills and
          their application in musical activities by using different study forms <br>and
          methods. During lessons the students sing in unison and  multi-part voices;

          playing skills are extended, wider opportunities are offered <br>for making
          music in different groups of players of musical instruments and the students
          also acquire <br>acoustic guitar chord techniques.  <br>Singing and playing
          musical instruments provide opportunities for the students to come up with
          their own <br>creations and implement creative ideas individually and in
          groups. As children in this age group exhibit <br> <br>19<br>considerable
          interest in pop and rock music, the school should provide possibilities
          for hobby pop/rock <br>group practice.  <br>In listening to music the stress
          is now on forming an opinion after having listened to a particular piece
          of <br>music and argument-supported justification of this opinion both orally
          and in writing, relying on musical <br>terminology.  <br>In all musical
          activities the students apply previously acquired knowledge and skills i.e.
          their musical <br>literacy gained through musical activities. <br>The students’
          personal performance skills are fostered both during lessons and outside
          of the <br>classroom/school (choirs, soloists and different groups of players
          of musical instruments). <br>To acquire listening experience, shape concert
          attendance culture and expand the students’ horizons, they <br>go to concerts
          and other musical performances and participate in educational outings, meet
          with locally and <br>nationally prominent composers and musicians. <br>
          By assessing themselves and their classmates, the students learn to mutually
          understand and respect <br>their abilities, skills and peculiarities.'

          skills and artistic skills in order to support their individual <br>development
          and ability to cope in a multicultural and changing world. Art allows basic

          of an active worldview and an enterprising attitude to life. <br> <br>20<br>
          <br>Art education contributes to the formation and development of the following
          constituent skills in students: <br>1) investigation and development of

          and reinforcement of new knowledge through <br>practical creative activities.
          Skill formation is a consistent process and the students associate their
