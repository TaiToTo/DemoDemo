      label: 'The optional course “Career education” is dedicated to the topics that
        shape students’ readiness for optimal <br>self-application on the labour market,
        development of independent decision-making skills, fulfilment of <br>different
        life roles and engagement in lifelong learning. Career studies enable improved
        implementation of <br>the human resources of our society on the labour market,
        bringing together the skills and interests of <br>people and various learning
        and working opportunities. Career studies contribute to the development of
        a <br>new generation, not limited by stereotypical gender roles, which have
        been ingrained in a particular culture <br>during a specific period as general
        shared concepts of femininity and masculinity. The innate differences <br>between
        women and men do not require them to choose only certain types of jobs and
        educational <br>specialisations. It is not appropriate to discuss male and
        female jobs separately from each other; the <br>information on health risks
        associated with different occupations enables both men and women make <br>knowledgeable
        choices, being aware of potential risk factors. <br> <br> <br>2 <br> <br>The
        syllabus of the optional course of career studies at the upper secondary school
        stage was compiled in <br>accordance with the syllabus of the optional course
        of career education for the 3rd stage of study of basic <br>school. At both
        school stages the main topics of career studies are the same and they must
        be taught in <br>accordance with the students’ age and degree of relevance,
        consistently and systematically. Many of the <br>topics connected with self-knowledge
        allow the students to monitor their own development (for instance, <br>look
        back at the description of personal interests made in the 9th grade and see
        what has changed in the <br>11th grade, etc.). <br>The difference between
        the content of career studies at the 3rd stage of study of basic school and
        the upper <br>secondary school stage is in certain topic stresses and depth
        or scope of treatment. The recurrent topics <br>are studied using various
        methods and different aspects of the topics are revealed, offering general
        or more <br>detailed information and tasks that require a lesser or greater
        degree of student independence, etc. The <br>content of career studies influences
        the steps that the students are likely to take after finishing the current
        <br>school stage. In addition to planning their further education, upper secondary
        school graduates are <br>prepared more thoroughly to enter the world of work.
        During the course, the students of the upper <br>secondary school stage are
        expected to exhibit greater independence, readiness for self-analysis and
        <br>confident presentation of the results to fellow students. <br> <br>The
        optional course consists of three parts: <br> <br>1. Study of the topic of
        self-knowledge and performance of corresponding practical tasks help the students
        <br>to shape their self-determination competence and, proceeding from self-analysis
        results, to make <br>informed decisions concerning further education and working
        life. Connections of social and learning <br>competence with future studies
        and working life are examined. Conscious shaping of learning habits <br>coupled
        with the shorter- or longer-term goals formulated in the career plan facilitates
        prevention of <br>interruptions to the students’ education. <br> <br>2. Career
        information: knowledge of learning opportunities, different work spheres and
        labour market trends <br>is necessary for the students to be able to plan
        their career in an informed manner. Student readiness <br>is shaped to flexibly
        react to rapid labour market changes and be engaged in lifelong learning.
        During <br>their practical familiarisation with the labour market, the students
        obtain an overview of different work <br>spheres and learn to pay attention
        to gender equality issues in their career choices. The students are <br>directed
        to research and, if possible, try different jobs and volunteer work and seek
        and find <br>connections between school studies and work spheres. Practical
        learning activities foster students’ <br>enterprising initiative. <br> <br>3.
        Knowledge of the principles of planning and decision-making helps the students
        with systematisation of <br>the information about themselves and labour market
        opportunities and association of this information <br>with future plans. The
        students analyse different factors that affect career choices. The following
        <br>student knowledge and skills are shaped: goal-setting, career-related
        decision-making, recognition of <br>likely problems and their prevention and
        importance of effectively combining work and private life. <br> <br>The optional
        course of career studies focuses on shaping adequate student self-assessment.
        The students <br>know the interconnections of specialties, professions and
        vocations. They can see and understand events <br>occurring in the world of
        work and are aware of the effect they have on personal employment career <br>planning.
        The students realise their responsibility and are motivated to plan their
        personal careers in an <br>informed manner. <br>3 <br> <br>Discussion of the
        gender equality principle in career planning raises students’ awareness of
        the possibility <br>of making any choices based on their preferences and abilities
        and of the availability of jobs that have been <br>traditionally associated
        with a particular gender preference. Career studies teach tolerance and freedom
        of <br>choice. Students understand that any wage issues are resolved based
        on the content and degree of <br>responsibility of a job, not a gender preference.
        Career studies offer assistance to the students in creating <br>an integral
        view of the knowledge, skills and experience acquired in other subjects, courses
        and various life <br>situations – this is the basis for career-related decision-making.'

      label: 'The optional course of career studies for the upper secondary school
        stage consists of 35 subject lessons. <br>The concrete content of the optional
        course is to be specified at the beginning of the course through <br>teacher-student
        cooperation. When determining sub-topics, selecting practical activities and
        so on, the <br>needs of each concrete study group are the starting point,
        but the following must also be taken into <br>account: whether, to what extent
        and how other activities that support career planning and personal <br>consultations
        are available within the framework of the curriculum for a particular study
        group. <br> <br>It is recommended to organise the following learning activities
        while teaching the course: <br>1) roleplay and other active learning methods
        and multifunctional methods; <br>2) filling in of questionnaires dedicated
        to self-analysis and working life, as well as thought development <br>sheets;
        <br>3) classroom lectures or independent student work online to acquire theoretical
        knowledge; <br>4) discussions and debates; <br>5) work with sources of career
        information and critical analysis of such information; <br>6) writing of essays;
        <br>7) research paper compilation (for example, about a certain sphere of
        work); <br>8) conducting of interviews (for example, with a representative
        of a certain type of profession); <br>9) conducting of professional suitability
        tests; <br>10) study outings and visits to companies; <br>11) independent
        work (for example, to become familiarised with different spheres of work);

        with the needs of the students of a particular study group <br>and optimised
        with activities in other subjects and extracurricular activities. It is recommended
        to prefer <br>active learning methods to lectures and use multifunctional
        methods that can be easily connected with <br>learning activities in other
        subjects.'

        the general part of the national <br>curriculum and other legislation that
        regulates such assessment. Assessed are the students’ knowledge, <br>their
        skills in implementing this knowledge and their acquisition of general competence
        on the basis of oral <br>answers (presentations), written and/or practical
        work and practical activities, taking into account how the <br>knowledge and
        skills of the students comply with the desired learning outcomes. The learning
        outcomes <br>are assessed using oral appraisal and numerical grades. <br>Assessment
        during career studies is not applicable to the attitudes and values of the
        students, but they <br>receive corresponding feedback if necessary and possible.
        Assessment takes into account the students’ <br>individuality and supports
        their development. The students must be active partners in the assessment
        <br>process, as such participation facilitates the shaping of self-analysis
        skills. <br>It is recommended for each student to compile, during the course,
        a personal learning portfolio, collecting in <br>it self-analysis, company
        visit worksheets and other results of study tasks, as well as other vocation-
        and <br>specialty-related materials of interest. The study tasks can be performed
        by the students individually or <br>working in groups. The learning portfolio’s
        defence can be assessed in the form of the overall grade for the <br>course.
        <br> <br>At the beginning of the course the students are explained what will
        be assessed, when and on what basis. <br>Assessment covers: <br>1) practical
        work: CV compilation; motivational letter, job application and essay; notes
        or summary of a <br>visit to a company and job shadowing; self-analysis summary
        and personal career plan (study <br>plan); etc.; <br>2) the skill of comprehending
        practical activities; <br>3) the skill of finding and analysing relevant information
        (summary of career information analysis); <br>4) creativity and rationality;
        <br>5) awareness of the main factors that affect career decisions; <br>6)
        the skill of independent analysis; and <br>7) achievement of the learning
        outcomes stipulated in the curriculum, which the students prove during <br>discussions,
        presentation of their group work-based learning portfolios and other activities.'
