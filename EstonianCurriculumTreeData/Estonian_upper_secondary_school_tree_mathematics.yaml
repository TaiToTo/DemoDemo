      label: Extensive and narrow mathematics differ by both content and approach.
        Extensive mathematics deals with <br>the terms and methods necessary to understand
        the nature of mathematics as a science. The purpose of <br>teaching narrow
        mathematics is observing the application of mathematics in order to describe
        the world <br>around human beings in a scientific manner and ensure success
        in life.  Students with deeper interest in <br>mathematics can use the study
        time for elective subjects, nationwide in-depth study forms and individual
        <br>study. The elective courses specified in the subject syllabus can be added
        to both narrow and extensive <br>mathematics.  <br>The required environment
        for this purpose is created by means of dealing with mathematical terms, <br>symbols,
        properties and relations, laws and procedures and by presenting trains of
        thought based on <br>intuition and logical discussions. Both narrow and extensive
        mathematics give pupils the tools and skills to <br>apply appropriate mathematical
        methods in other subjects. <br>Students with deeper interest in mathematics
        can use the study time for elective subjects, nationwide in-<br>depth study
        forms and individual study.  <br>The obligatory courses included in the syllabus
        can be added to both narrow and extensive mathematics.  <br>The pupils who
        study narrow mathematics are allowed to switch to extensive mathematics and
        the pupils <br>who study extensive mathematics are allowed to switch to narrow
        mathematics. The conditions of transition <br>are provided in the school curriculum

      label: 'The study of mathematics develops all general competences described
        in the national curriculum for upper <br>secondary school students. The teacher
        plays a crucial role in shaping the four interconnected components <br>of
        competences – knowledge, skills, values and behaviour – with the teacher’s
        values and self-assertion <br>skills creating a suitable learning environment
        and influencing upper secondary school students’ values and <br>behaviour.  <br>Cultural
        and value competence. By studying mathematics, pupils become familiar with
        the achievements <br>of mathematicians from different countries and eras,
        which enables them to recognise connections <br>between different cultures.
        Pupils are guided to recognise the elegance of logical trains of thought and
        <br>notice the harmony of geometrical figures in architecture and nature.
        Persistence, objectivity, preciseness <br>and diligence are developed. <br>Social
        and citizenship competence. Responsibility towards society and fellow citizens
        is raised by <br>solving word problems with relevant content. Various paired
        and group work assignments help to develop <br>cooperation and mutual assistance
        skills and enable teachers to use different forms of collective work in <br>mathematics
        lessons as well. Education increases tolerance towards students with different
        mathematical <br>abilities.   <br>Self-awareness competence. By means of independent
        problem solving with varying levels of difficulty, <br>pupils can assess and
        develop their mathematical abilities. For this purpose, open problem-solving  <br>problems
        are most suitable. <br>Learning to learn competence. By solving problems,
        pupils develop analytical, rational method finding <br>and critical outcome
        assessment skills. Solving of text problems helps to develop functional reading
        skills: <br>ability to differentiate important and unimportant elements and
        see connections between objects. They also <br>expand their generalisation
        and analogy-using skills as well as the skill of using the acquired knowledge
        in <br>new situations. Pupils are guided towards the understanding that ideas
        of solution of problems can only be <br>found by using independent thought.
        <br>Communication competence. Mathematics develops pupils’ ability to express
        their ideas clearly, briefly <br>and precisely. Above all, this takes place
        by means of presenting correct definitions, formulating <br>hypotheses and
        assertions or theorems and also when formulating solutions of problems. By
        solving word <br>problems, pupils develop their functional reading skills:
        they learn how to distinguish between the relevant <br>and the irrelevant
        and see the relations between objects. Mathematics has an important role in
        developing <br>preparedness to understand, associate and communicate information
        presented in different ways. <br>Mathematics also expands pupils’ ability
        to formulate information presented in everyday language and vice <br>versa,
        to present the content of mathematical symbols and formulas in everyday language.
        <br>Entrepreneurial competence. New mathematical knowledge is often acquired
        by means of analysing the <br>characteristics of the objects under observation:
        pupils study the common properties of the objects, on the <br>basis of which
        they formulate a hypothesis and come up with ideas to justify the validity
        of the hypothesis. <br>Education develops the skill of seeing and formulating
        problems, generating and analysing ideas. Changes <br>caused by different
        parameters of an object can be examined by solving problems involving probability
        <br>theory and functions. Identification of different solution paths for a
        problem improves the flexibility of <br>thought. Finding different solutions
        to a problem develops pupils’ flexible thinking. Entrepreneurial <br>competence
        is also developed by means of solving various problems involving actual data
        and through <br>long-term projects. <br>4 <br> <br>Natural sciences and technology
        competence. Studying mathematics is inevitable to use technological <br>aids
        in solving problems. Mathematics as a language of science allows to understand
        the significance of <br>science and technology development.'

      label: The cross-curricular topics introduced in the general part of the curriculum
        are primarily realised in upper <br>secondary school mathematics lessons by
        systematically organising study activities and the topical content <br>of
        various problems. <br>Lifelong learning and career planning.  <br>The study
        of mathematics through various learning activities helps to shape students’
        preparation to <br>understand and appreciate lifelong learning as a lifestyle
        and to interpret career planning as a continuous <br>decision making process.
        Educational activities offer opportunities for direct contacts with the world
        of <br>employment, e.g., through visits to undertakings, presentations of
        occupations, professions and further <br>education opportunities related to
        the subject field. Education develops independent study skills and <br>responsibility,
        as well as skills to find and analyse information on further education opportunities,
        based on <br>one’s development needs, and to prepare a career plan.  Various
        learning activities, including independent <br>projects, enable students to
        link their interests and abilities with subject-specific knowledge and skills
        and to <br>understand that hobbies can help to balance personal life and career.
        Realistic assessment of one’s <br>abilities is a crucial precondition of further
        career planning. Mathematics lessons develop the ability of <br>abstract and
        logical reasoning, which is necessary for weighing different impact factors
        in career choice. <br>Students develop their studying and communication skills,
        as well as cooperation, decision making and <br>information handling skills,
        which are also required in future employment.   <br>Environment and sustainable
        development. When analysing the environmental resources data, pupils <br>are
        encouraged to develop a sustainable attitude towards their surroundings and
        taught to value the <br>physical and social environment. When handling the
        topic, descriptive mathematics related to percentage <br>calculation, change
        and relation and elements of statistics are relevant. <br>Cultural identity.  An
        introduction to the history of mathematics and relations between the development
        of <br>society and mathematical science are relevant. By means of percentage
        calculation and statistics, pupils <br>are able to describe the processes
        occurring in society in relation to the topic of the multicultural world.
        <br>Geometry plays an important part in the cultural sphere. <br>Civil initiative
        and enterprise. Finding different solution paths for problems is associated
        with enterprise. <br>Initiative and cooperation skills can be developed through
        research, group work and projects. <br>Technology and innovation. By means
        of integrating mathematics courses with technology and natural <br>sciences,
        pupils can become familiar with the methods of describing and modelling technological
        <br>processes. Pupils using the ICT solve actual problems and make studying
        more efficient. Studying <br>5 <br> <br>mathematics make opportunities to
        discover, notice regularities and contribute the development of creative <br>people.
        <br>Information environment. Statistics and percentage calculations contribute
        to an understanding of media <br>manipulations and development of critical
        information analysis skills. <br>Health and safety. Problems including health
        and safety data can teach how to assess risk factors based <br>on objective
        data.  <br>Values and morality. The study of mathematics develops decency,
        diligence, systematic approach, <br>persistence, steadiness and integrity.
        Mathematics plays an important role in developing a tolerant attitude <br>to
        fellow students with different abilities.

      label: 'Learning and Educational Objectives <br>The objective of the optional
        course is that students: <br>1) know the basic terms of geometry, main results
        of polygons and circles and are able to use main <br>methods to prove them
        (parallelism, congruence, similarity, a method of angles at the <br>circumference
        and a method of additional constructions); <br>2) are able to creatively use
        the methods learnt to solve (proving) problems  of synthetic geometry <br>and
        perform simple drawings correctly by means of compass and a ruler and/or a
        ICT tools using a <br>programme of dynamic geometry; and <br>3) develop creative
        and flexible mathematical thinking. <br> <br>Description of Course <br>The
        course consists of four basic fields: <br>1) classification and main properties
        of polygons (quadrangles); <br>2)  cyclic quadrilateral; <br>3) line segments
        (midlines, medians, bisectors, heights and mediators) and circumferences (inscribed
        <br>and circumscribed circle) related to a triangle; and <br>4) construction
        problems. <br> <br>Learning Outcomes <br>At the end of the course, student
        can: <br>1) deduce formulas to find the sum of the interior and exterior angles
        of a polygon and the number of <br>diagonals and use them to solve (proving)
        problems ; <br>2) define the terms ‘congruence of polygons’ and ‘similarity
        of polygons’ and use the methods of <br>congruence and similarity to solve
        (proving)  problems; <br>3) know the definitions and properties of quadrangles
        (square, rectangle, rhombus, parallelogram and <br>trapezoid) and use them
        to solve (proving)problems; <br>29 <br> <br>4) formulate and prove the necessary
        and sufficient conditions for a quadrangle to be a cyclic <br>quadrilateral
        and use the method of  cyclic quadrilateral to solve (proving) problems and
        to justify <br>the position of the four points on a circumference; <br>5)
        define the terms of the segments (midline, median, bisector, height and mediator)
        related to a <br>triangle and prove their main properties and use the results
        to solve (proving)tasks; <br>6) use different methods to prove that the three
        medians (bisector, mediator and height) of any <br>triangle intersect at a
        point; <br>7) know  cross point of given segments  where locate centers  of
        the interior and exterior <br>circumference of a triangle and use this to
        solve (proving)problems; and <br>8) achieve a certain skills  for solving
        basic construction problems by means of compass and a ruler. <br> <br>Learning
        Content <br> <br>Polygons: convex and non-convex  polygons and regular polygons.
        Sum of interior and exterior angles of a <br>polygon. Diagonals of polygons.
        Congruence and similarity of polygons. Necessary and sufficient <br>conditions
        for a quadrangle to be a square (rectangle, rhombus, parallelogram or trapezoid).
        <br>Cyclic quadrilateral. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a quadrangle
        to be an inscribed quadrangle: <br>angles at the circumference  resting on
        the same arc, angles at the circumference positioned opposite to <br>each
        other, product of the lengths of the segments of diagonals (the property of
        intersecting chords of a <br>circumference) and Ptolemy’s Theorem. Four points
        positioned on a circumference. <br>Segments and circumferences in a triangle:
        midline of a triangle and the properties of the midlines and <br>triangles
        formed from these segments. Necessary and sufficient condition for a point
        to be  located on a <br>bisector of a given angle (on the mediator of a given
        segment). Theorems on intersection of the medians of <br>a triangle (bisectors,
        heights and mediators) at a given point. Interior and exterior circumference
        of a <br>triangle. <br>Construction  problems. Basic construction by means
        of compass and a ruler (bisector of a given angle, <br>mediator of a segment,
        construction of a perpendicular or a parallel line on a line from a given
        point, <br>construction of an interior and exterior circumference of a triangle,
        construction of a tangent of a <br>circumference, division of a segment in
        a given ratio and construction of polygons). Historical overview of <br>the
        possibility of performing classical construction problems (quadrature of a
        circle, duplication of a cube <br>and trisection of an angle).'
