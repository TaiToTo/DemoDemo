        a <br>practical command of the language. Therefore, each course in linguistic
        knowledge is followed by and <br>integrated with a practical language course.
        These courses can also be taught in parallel. The themes <br>covered within
        the course of linguistic knowledge, cross-curricular topics in the curriculum
        and the themes <br>covered in the literature course are used in the practical
        language course as themes for speech <br>development, reading, listening and
        writing. Practical language courses focus on developing students’ <br>spoken
        and written communication, reflection and self-expression skills; on creating
        different types of text <br>combined with finding and using necessary information.
        Relevant issues in orthography and orthology are <br>revised during every
        course. <br>The subject syllabus in literature focuses on texts and readers.
        An attention is paid to understanding the <br>literary work as a whole, to
        analysing and interpreting texts, to figurative language and to the poesy.
        The <br>first and third courses focus on analysing and interpreting literary
        works of different types. The knowledge <br>acquired is used in the ‘Newer
        Literature’ course and in two more general courses, but also in optional <br>courses.
        Estonian literature is integrated into every course. Integration with theatre
        and cinematography is <br>made possible through relevant optional courses.
        <br>Language and literature courses are linked by working on the texts: text
        understanding and interpretation, <br>differentiating between and analysing
        linguistic and stylistic means of expression and writing based on <br>3 <br>

        text. <br> <br>Russian language and literature. The subject syllabus of Russian
        language includes six courses. <br>Requirements for the completion of courses
        are specified in the school curriculum. The central notion in <br>language
        instruction is the text. Students acquire knowledge in the functions and composition
        of different <br>text types and learn to understand, assess and create them
        both orally and in writing. Taking different <br>courses develops students’
        communication as well as oral and written expression skills and their correct
        <br>language use. They learn to use different sources of information, including
        the Internet, to find linguistic <br>information and to compile texts. <br>
        <br>The structure of the subject syllabus in literature is literary-historic:
        four courses cover world literature from <br>the 19th century to the present
        day, and the fifth course is Estonian literature. Optional courses deal with
        the <br>earlier period of world literature (until the 17th century) and contemporary
        Russian and foreign literature. In <br>addition to the literary-historical
        principle, the subject syllabus in literature also follows the problem-theme
        <br>principle. Literary works are analysed in the artistic and social context
        of their time; students learn to notice <br>artistic peculiarities and problems
        posed in texts, and to link the works with the life and problems of modern
        <br>society. In examining literary works, students learn to formulate and
        express their opinions both orally and <br>in writing. Studying Estonian literature
        in Estonian helps develop students’ command of Estonian and their <br>integration
        into Estonian cultural space. <br> <br>Language and literature studies are
        connected through language and working on texts. The subject <br>syllabus
        in Russian language covers different text types and their linguistic features,
        including the language <br>of fiction. The subject syllabus in literature
        deals first and foremost with the analysis of literary texts, <br>discussing
        their content and problems and writing texts in different genres based on
        them.'

        are reflected in text creation, presentations and reflections. The teacher
        <br>plays a crucial role in shaping the four interconnected components of

        of the specific character, development and usages of native language, attitude
        towards <br>literature as an artistic expression and towards writers as creators.
        The study of language and literature <br>shapes students’ moral values, social

        from different sources and using it with a critical attitude, preparing different
        types of texts, and <br>developing and formulating personal opinions. <br>Communication
        competence. Language and literature lessons contribute to spoken and written
        <br>communication skills, the ability to show consideration for the conversation
        partner and select a suitable <br>behaviour, and the skill to present and
        justify one’s opinions. Education and study texts lay a foundation for <br>reflection,

        to read information graphs or other types of visual information, to find numerical
        data, to analyse <br>information that has been found, to associate it with
        verbal information and to interpret it. Calculation skills <br>are developed
        through conversion of measurement units used in older texts. Students learn

        of age-appropriate problems identified in media and literary texts, as well
        as in students’ daily <br>life, by adopting a position with regard to them

        of the language in the four <br>areas of constituent skills: reading, writing,
        speaking and listening. <br> <br>Reading skills are developed by reading texts
        from different spheres and analysing and critically judging <br>their content.
        In teaching reading, it is observed that the level of difficulty of texts
        studied increases in line <br>with the development of reading skills and that
        both linked (descriptive and narrative) and unlinked texts <br>(tables, graphs,
        lists, etc.) are represented. An important part in the development of students’
        reading skills <br>is broadening their vocabulary, and in order to achieve
        this, new words (less known words, foreign words <br>and figurative expressions)
        are systematically acquired throughout the subject. An important component
        of <br>reading competence is the ability to find necessary texts both in printed
        and online sources and to seek <br>information in them. A broader aim in developing
        reading skills is the formation of critical information users <br>and individuals
        who understand ethical values. <br> <br>Writing skills are developed by creating
        texts for different purposes and with different compositions. Most <br>text
        types that students create in subject teaching are familiar to them from basic
        school in terms of their <br>composition and requirements. The aim of developing
        writing skills is to achieve mastery in the creation of <br>such texts. The
        skill of writing texts based on source texts is very important; so are skills
        in linking <br>information received from other texts with one’s own texts
        as well as knowing how to refer, quote and <br>review. The prerequisite and
        one of the components of writing competence is good and functional <br>orthography.
        Thus, orthographic skills are constantly developed and practised by writing
        assignments. <br> <br>7 <br> <br>The central task in developing speaking skills
        is to develop the ability to select a suitable tone and stylistic <br>means
        based on communication situations and partners. It is also important to know
        how to start, expand <br>and avert communication. Speaking skills are developed
        through different communication tasks, pair and <br>group work discussions,
        making presentations in front of the class and answering questions while seated.
        <br>Real-life communication situations are practised in role-plays. An important
        component of speaking skills is <br>arguing and the ability to present and
        defend one’s standpoints by using rational, emotional and ethical <br>argumentations.
        Argument skills are developed through discussions, debates and panel discussions.
        <br> <br>The aims of developing listening skills are to understand the communication
        objective of the partner and <br>to identify persuasion and manipulation and
        the main idea of oral information and reference texts. The skill <br>of asking
        meaningful and relevant questions of the speaker is important as well. Summarising
        discussions <br>and lectures and analysing political speeches are one way
        of developing listening skills. <br>Based on the learning objectives and outcomes
        of literature, the study activities in lessons of literature are <br>connected
        with reading, analysing and interpreting fiction and culture-related informative
        texts, including <br>essays, but also with oral and written self-expression.
        Reader and text-centred approaches to literature <br>prioritise reading and
        other activities related to it; literary history is less important. <br> <br>There
        are different study methods of literature in lessons, ranging from close reading
        of texts to the <br>comparative historical method. Study activities should
        help students penetrate texts; analyse, synthesise, <br>compare and assess
        them and use them in practice. In dealing with literature, it is important
        to avoid using <br>the same method. For instance it is possible to: <br>1)
        analyse literary works against the overall culture of the period or find links
        with the history, fine <br>arts and philosophy of the period; <br>2) observe
        literary works as the reflection and expansion of a writer’s life; <br>3)
        explore the relationships and meanings of structural elements in texts: both
        by reading and by <br>writing; <br>4) analyse the texts from the narrator’s
        position: create time and place of action, draw up text <br>spaces, explore
        the links between plot and story line, narration etc.; <br>5) interpret the
        keywords in statements, formulate one’s opinion or questions, present arguments,
        <br>find the essence and relate it to works read before, organise information
        and present it <br>graphically; <br>6) compare and contrast information and
        point out common and specific features; <br>7) find links between texts: in
        narrative, composition, characters, episodes, motives, single words <br>and
        phrases; <br>8) find archetextual links: in plots, character types, motives
        and expressions; <br>9) transform texts into another genre; <br>10) analyse
        different styles and sub-languages and their blending in literary texts; <br>11)
        compare the means of expression in fiction to techniques used in film and
        theatre; and <br>12) deal with the poetics of art and explore one’s reading
        skills, preferences and reading history, <br>different reader groups and reading
        models. <br> <br>The objectives of literary studies are best achieved by watching
        movies and documentaries based on <br>literary works or introducing literary
        history, listening to sound recordings, visiting theatre performances and
        <br>museums and performing assignments related to the activities. <br> <br>In
        addition to fiction, students also read metatexts in literature lessons that
        support literary studies. This <br>enhances their skills in using varied information
        means and shapes their critical attitude towards online <br>8 <br> <br>sources.
        By reading essays and literary criticism and using it in analysing literary
        works, students learn to <br>quote and review correctly and understand the
        meaning of copyright and plagiarism. Reading texts <br>appropriate to the
        students’ age facilitates working with full texts by offering different interpretation
        options <br>based on the individual, period, culture etc. It is instructive
        to seek information on the problems, ideas, time <br>and place of action etc.,
        find the lead idea in the text and relate it to one’s own life and reading
        experience, <br>point out and rephrase important ideas, summarise the material
        read or present the information in another <br>form, formulate pros and cons,
        ask questions based on the texts or answer them and analyse statements <br>drawn
        up on texts. In the text-poetic approach, it is advisable to use the comparative
        model asserting <br>common and specific features of texts. <br> <br>The materials
        covered in literature lessons are better acquired if the knowledge is used
        orally or in writing. <br>To this end it is advisable to write varied options
        for analysing, discussing and creative writing as well as  <br>use oral expression
        techniques (group work presentations, reports, speeches and debates). Role-plays
        and <br>staging are important both in interpreting the works as well as in
        developing students’ presentation skills <br>and courage. <br> <br>In planning
        the studies, it is advisable to follow the principle of active learning (including
        discovery, enquiry-<br>based, problem-based and project-base learning) by
        enabling the students to work independently, in pairs <br>and in groups in
        order to develop their cooperation skills and sense of duty. <br> <br>In planning
        the learning activities, teachers have a professional right, in cooperation
        with students, to make <br>choices regarding the presentation of contents
        with a view of ensuring achievement of required learning <br>outcomes and
        development of general and field-specific competences, based on students’
        existing <br>knowledge and skills.'

        curriculum for upper secondary <br>schools. The objective of verifying and
        assessing learning outcomes in language and literature is to receive <br>an
        overview of the level of attainment of learning outcomes and individual development
        of students, and to <br>use this information for more productive planning
        of studies. Assessment covers knowledge and respective <br>application skills
        as well as attainment of general competences, incl. learning to learn skills,
        based on oral <br>answers, written assignments and practical activities. Selection
        of assessment methods is made in <br>consideration of students’ age-specific
        differences, individual abilities and preparedness to handle specific <br>activities.
        Learning outcomes are assessed with verbal assessments and numerical grades.
        <br>Students have to be informed about what and when is going to be assessed,
        which assessment tools and <br>criteria will be used. Diverse forms of verifying
        and assessing learning outcomes should be used. Formative <br>assessment to
        support students has an important role.  <br>In Estonian language, assessment
        covers the following: <br>focusing primarily on comparing students’ development
        with their previous accomplishments. Assessment <br>criteria and any assessment
        procedures that deviate from the standard five-grade system are specified
        in <br>the school curriculum.  <br>1) correct spoken and written language
        use; <br>2) comprehension and critical analysis of different types of spoken
        and written texts; <br>3) text creation skills; <br>9 <br> <br>4) argumentation
        skills; <br>5) skill to use information sources. <br>In Literature, assessment
        covers the following:  <br>1) reading, interpreting and analysing literary
        works; <br>2) argumentation skills; <br>3) skill to create and present different
        types of text; <br>4) knowledge of main development directions of Estonian
        and world literature; <br>5) understanding of and proficiency in specific
        characteristics of literary language use. <br>The results of assignments in
        ‘Practical Estonian’ lessons, which demonstrate attainment of learning <br>outcomes
        in literature courses or other Estonian language courses, can be assessed
        and taken into <br>account as partial contributions towards completion of
        the respective courses. Similarly, any activities in the <br>framework of
        assignments in literature courses or other Estonian language courses can be
        assessed and <br>taken into account as partial contributions towards completion
        of the ‘Practical Estonian’ course if they <br>support attainment of the learning
        outcomes of the ‘Practical Estonian’ course.'

        label: 'The content of Estonian as a subject consists of two related but cognitively
          different areas: linguistic <br>knowledge and practical command of the language.
          The courses in Estonian seek to arouse students’ <br>interest in linguistics
          and philology in general and to provide them with practical skills comparable
          to basic <br>knowledge. <br> <br>The Estonian language is both the language
          of instruction and the central subject in the school. Good <br>command of
          Estonian creates the preconditions for making progress in all subjects,
          while all other subjects <br>develop the key competences of language use:
          understanding and using vocabulary, text understanding <br>and text creation
          and the competence of oral and written communication. Hence students develop
          their <br>functional and critical literacy through studying Estonian and
          other subjects. <br>Also, a systematic overview is given of the media and
          influence. Such issues as constructing reality through <br>the media or
          how different approaches to one and the same event are created and which
          language tools <br>are used are dealt with. This relates to media ethics,
          which is also examined. Other issues include <br>advertisements and their
          influencing techniques, electronic media and new ways of communication created
          <br>by it, dangers and manipulation options related to them. Media instruction
          seeks to shape critical media <br>consumers. <br> <br>The issues of the
          language and style of texts are dealt with in greater detail. Stylistic
          and linguistic <br>differences of various text types are covered; stylistic
          stratifications and connotations of vocabulary, <br>components of writing
          and demands on the language of different types of texts are also examined.
          <br>Systematic overviews of main stylistic errors are given. <br> <br>The
          practical command of Estonian means proficiency in reading, writing, speaking
          and listening. A broader <br>aim in developing reading skills is to shape
          critical information users. Writing skills are developed by <br>creating
          texts for different purposes and with different compositions, teaching how
          to refer to, quote and <br>summarise other texts i.e. write based on source
          texts. The prerequisite and one component of writing <br>competence is good
          and functional orthography. Speaking skills comprise both public presentation
          skills <br>and the ability to choose appropriate tone and style. The aim
          of developing listening skills is to understand <br>the partner and the
          speaker, to identify factual information and opinions as well as influencing
          and <br>manipulating in oral media channels, and to be prepared to ask further

        label: 'Literary studies in upper secondary school is one of the central subjects
          in culture and arts, which supports <br>the development of aesthetical and
          ethical beliefs in young people and helps to enrich their intellect and
          <br>self-expression skills, add variety to communication, understand other
          people’s experiences, and find <br>deeper meaning in society and culture.
          The task of literature education is to ensure continuity of culture and
          <br>sustainability of society. <br>Literary studies in upper secondary school
          rely on what was acquired in literature lessons in basic school <br>and
          proceed with text and reader-centred instruction. Particular attention is
          paid to understanding literary <br>works as a whole and analysing and interpreting
          texts from different aspects. As a piece of wordmanship is <br>based on
          image, the subject content emphasises the artistic aspect of literature,
          which includes <br>understanding the poetics of literature and its figurativeness
          in its notional and emotional integrity and <br>ambiguity. Instead of a
          diachronic i.e. literary and historical approach, a synchronic approach
          i.e. one <br>focusing on movements, trends, genres or themes or the intertwining
          of the two is preferred, enabling <br>transition from text-centred analysis
          to backgrounds, summaries and connections beyond the text. If <br>possible,
          Estonian and world literature are examined comparatively. <br>Literary studies
          follow subject-based integration, where varied linguistic, scientific, historical
          and cultural <br>insights and skills complement each other, but also pay
          attention to integration between subjects by <br>facilitating better understanding
          of fine arts, music, theatre, film, cultural heritage and modern culture
          in <br>general. In order to define cultural historical background, other
          subjects need to be referred to besides <br>literature: history, social
          theory and introduction to man, geography, music, art, philosophy, etc.
          <br>The compulsory courses in their recommended order take into account
          the students’ abilities in abstract <br>reasoning, its development and their
          reading experience. The courses provide opportunities for integration <br>within
          the subject and beyond and their sequence relies on and uses what was learned
          previously. If <br>necessary, the learning content within the course can
          be changed, but in such a way that its unity and <br>subject logic is not
          harmed. The works read in full during the course are linked to relevant
          themes through <br>reflection. The teacher selects the works to be read
          in full, based on the specific character of the school <br>and the class.
          <br>17 <br> <br> <br> <br>The selection of literary works listed in the
          learning content of the courses takes into account reasonable <br>proportions
          of Estonian and world literature and classical and contemporary literature.
          The works selected <br>for the reading list should facilitate development
          of general competences and discussion of cross-curricular <br>topics, while
          representing a diverse range of genres.  <br>From the works listed in the
          learning content, teachers select the appropriate number of works set out
          in <br>the learning outcome for full reading and more detailed examination
          by taking into account students’ <br>preferences and abilities. The works
          of other authors named in the learning content are introduced either in
          <br>general or by analysing and interpreting shorter text examples. The
          recurrence of authors and their works <br>in the learning content of different
          courses is intentional: the aim is to enable the teachers to set up courses
          <br>flexibly. It is advisable that students whose mother tongue is not Estonian
          read and analyse one literary <br>work from the literature of the country
          representing their home language. <br>The role of obligatory literature
          courses in upper secondary school is to teach the meaning and use of <br>literary
          terms, identification of literary movements and genres in the context of
          their respective eras, <br>analysis and interpretation of different types
          of literary works; to provide an overview of the works and <br>literary
          significance of major international and Estonian authors; to explain the
          importance of literature as a <br>reflection of different time periods and
          thought schools; to train students to read texts, which require greater
          <br>intellectual effort, and to refine literary taste of young people. <br>Optional
          courses link literature with other arts and deal with metaliterary themes.
          The aim of the courses is <br>to broaden students’ worldviews and offer
          a deeper insight into literature.  <br> <br>2.2.3 Learning outcomes in upper
          secondary school <br> <br>Graduates of upper secondary school: <br> <br>1)

        label: '25 <br> <br>At the stage of upper secondary school, which completes
          general education, it is essential to facilitate the <br>social adjustment
          of students by taking into account the specifics and actual needs of the
          labour market. <br>Theoretical knowledge of Russian and a practical command
          of it contribute to becoming active members of <br>today’s society and finding
          reputable jobs, particularly in such spheres as translating, publishing,
          editing, <br>teaching, research, tourism, social work, health care and business.
          The socialisation of students is partly <br>ensured by achieving the main
          objectives of the subject syllabus and by performing the individual tasks
          set <br>out in it.  <br> <br>The ultimate goal of Russian language studies
          is the ability to solve actual communications tasks by using <br>language
          tools. Proficiency in Russian serves as a basis for successful learning
          of other languages and <br>subjects, helps shape the students’ worldviews,
          broadens their horizons and develops their thinking. <br> <br>Theoretical
          knowledge is the foundation for a practical command of the language and
          thus the subject <br>syllabus of the upper secondary school covers three
          types of learning material: knowledge of the language, <br>linguistic skills
          and communicative skills. Upper secondary school teachers must have good
          knowledge of <br>modern linguistics and be experienced in using new technology
          and teaching methods. Practical courses <br>require application of acquired
          theoretical knowledge. <br> <br>The subject syllabus of Russian in upper
          secondary school is based on the general to specific principle. <br>The
          course ‘Language and Society’ is the most general. The subject includes
          a thorough discussion of the <br>functions of language in society: language
          as a system of symbols, the structure and character of Russian <br>in comparison
          to other languages of the world, Russian dialects and the historical development
          of Russian <br>literary standard based on the dialects. An important element
          is discussion of language variability – <br>differentiation between literary
          standard and vernacular, different sub-languages and slang and their <br>applications.
          The course also covers issues of Russian language development. Understanding
          the relations <br>between language and society facilitates understanding
          of language as an information exchange system <br>and a central expression
          of identity.  <br>The course ‘Text in Language and Speech: Text Stylistics’
          provides students with theoretical knowledge of <br>the structure of texts
          and of creating, understanding and assessing different types of texts used
          in varied <br>communication situations. The course provides an in-depth
          examination of the language and style of text. It <br>covers linguistic
          and stylistic differences between text types, examines stylistic layers
          and meaning <br>nuances of vocabulary, as well as components of writing
          and requirements for the language of different text <br>types. The course
          provides a systematic overview of common stylistic errors.   <br>The four
          courses in practical Russian (‘Speech culture’, ‘Reception and Creation
          of Spoken Text’, <br> ‘Reception and Creation of Written Text’, ‘Correction
          Course in Orthography and Punctuation’) refine the <br>skills, which are
          required for comprehending and creating spoken and written texts. Practical
          Russian <br>proficiency means fluent use of the literary standard by combining
          the skills of text reception and creation – <br>reading, writing, speaking
          and listening – with the bonding skill of mediation. A broader aim in developing
          <br>reading skills is to shape critical information users. Writing skills
          are developed by creating texts for <br>different purposes and with different
          compositions. An important part of this is the ability to relate the <br>information
          gathered from other texts to one’s own text and to take into account, refer
          to, quote and <br>summarise other texts i.e. write based on source texts.
          Furthermore, a significant part of Russian language <br>instruction is traditionally
          dedicated to students’ spoken language. A course in practical Russian is
          <br>envisaged for upper secondary school to improve students’ orthology
          skills through engagement with <br>orthography and punctuation. Spoken language
          proficiency means both the skill of public presentation and <br>26 <br>
          <br>the ability to choose a tone and style appropriate for the communication
          situation and conversation partner, <br>as well as the ability to initiate
          communication or to start, develop and avoid different topics.  The objective
          <br>of the development of listening skills is the ability to understand
          a conversation partner. <br> <br>2.3.3 Learning outcomes in upper secondary
          school <br> <br>Graduates of upper secondary school: <br>1) have acquired
          basic linguistic knowledge of the language as a system and its realisation

        label: 'The study of literature in upper secondary school is based on slightly
          different principles than in basic <br>school, because the problematic and
          thematic approach is combined with the historical and literary <br>principle.
          The students gain an idea of the main periods in literature in chronological
          order and explore the <br>specific features of different literary movements.
          Literary works are analysed in the context of the period in <br>which they
          were created, by shaping their value attitudes and moral benchmarks. Through
          examination of <br>literary works, students are taught to be more respectful
          and open towards the cultures of other people and <br>to develop more persistent
          cognitive interests. <br> <br>The content of the subject is based on reading
          and examining literary works, what refines aesthetic tastes, <br>but at
          the same time facilitates the development of national cultural awareness
          and self-knowledge. The <br>literature helps students understand themselves
          and their uniqueness in the changing world and choose <br>their goals in
          life knowledgeably. The study of literature in upper secondary school focuses
          first and <br>foremost on developing reader’s awareness and on building
          personified i.e. responsible and emotional <br>relationships with literature.  <br>
          <br>The course ‘Literature in the 1st half of the 19th Century: Romanticism
          and the Rise of Realism’ introduces <br>the historical and cultural preconditions
          for the rise of romanticism, its main stages of development and <br>specific
          artistic features of romanticist writers in the literature of different
          nations. In examining single <br>monographs, the works of essential representatives
          of romanticism are introduced. The best known works <br>of Romanticism are
          selected for reading and analysis. Special attention is paid to the reflection
          of the <br>romantic view of the world in literary works, to the concept
          of the romantic hero and to the main techniques <br>of romanticist poetics.
          Discussion focuses primarily on the concepts shared by all romanticists
          on the value <br>and uniqueness of the personality, the inner contradictions
          and the passion for freedom innate in every <br>human being. <br> <br>The
          study of the works of writers representing different national literature
          enables the common features of <br>Romanticism and varieties of romanticist
          poetics of different authors to be highlighted. Romanticism is <br>explored
          as a form of aesthetic cognition of reality which is not seen as being overridden
          by Realism, but as <br>a specific way of contrasting with Classicism. Along
          with this, how Romanticism gradually exhausted its <br>means and gave birth
          to the rudiments of depicting the new, real world and its people is also
          observed. <br> <br>The course ‘Literature in the 2nd half of the 19th Century:
          Realism’ turns attention to the main stages of the <br>genesis and development
          of Realism and its differences from earlier literary movements. By analysing
          the <br>works of outstanding representatives of Realism in national literature,
          students become familiar with the <br>principles of realist poetics, the
          hero of the concept of Realism and the interpretation of complex <br>relationships
          between individuals and society. <br> <br>The versatility of Realism enables
          the students’ notion of the individual style of writers, the forms of <br>expression
          of their author’s position, the ways of depicting the characters and the
          development of <br>psychologism to be significantly deepened. At the same
          time, their concept of the genre system of literature <br>is also broadened.
          <br>33 <br> <br> <br>The combining of the historical and literary and problematic
          and thematic approaches which forms the <br>basis of the course presumes
          more-or-less full coverage of the creative biography of realist writers,
          the <br>periods of creating the works examined and understanding their historical
          conditionality. The discussed <br>problems are formulated so to emphasise
          the timeless meaning of the works examined. It is very important <br>that
          students perceive literary classics through the prism of the problems and
          phenomena of the present <br>day. The scope of the course necessitates strict
          selection of works to be dealt with in greater detail, <br>because the most
          important thing is to provoke students’ interest in this essential period
          of world literature <br>and encourage them to read independently. <br> <br>The
          course ‘Literature in the 1st half of the 20th Century’ introduces students
          to Russian literature (both in <br>the metropolis and in exile), but also
          to texts of Estonian and foreign literature of the period. One of the key
          <br>objectives of the course is to broaden students’ historical and literary
          knowledge and their familiarity with <br>the terms characterising the literature
          of the early 20th century. <br> <br>The works of writers representing modernist
          and avant-garde literary trends, movements and groupings in <br>Russian,
          Estonian and world literature are examined. The first half of the 20th century
          was a period of <br>modernising the language of poetry, when new artistic
          means of expression were developed in varied <br>genres of literature. The
          compulsory  literary works are selected so that students gain an idea of
          the most <br>important tendencies in the literature of the period (neo-romanticism,
          symbolism and decadence, akhmeism <br>and futurism) but also of the interaction
          of these phenomena in a specific work of art. <br> <br>The course ‘Literature
          in the 2nd half of the 20th Century’ explores the tendencies and phenomena
          in world <br>literature after World War II. The course gives students an
          idea of the main historical and literary and social <br>and cultural processes
          in world literature from the second half of the 20th century and the beginning
          of the <br>21st century. Students become familiar with the biographies and
          literary output of writers and their works in <br>the context of world literature.
          Due to the large volume of material, teachers select some works for <br>compulsory
          reading; others are reviewed in general. <br> <br>In dealing with the works
          from this period, it is essential to pay attention to the versatile genres
          of the works <br>covered during the course, to the abundance of trends and
          movements which characterise the literary <br>process and to its organic
          connection with the literature of earlier periods. As in previous courses,
          the <br>emphasis is on the moral and humane problems in the works studied.
          <br> <br>The course ‘Estonian Literature’ is a general course covering the
          development of Estonian literature from <br>the beginning of the national
          movement of the 19th century to the present day and outstanding authors
          and <br>works at different stages of development. The course is taken in
          Estonian. The aim of the course is to <br>relate students to Estonian literature
          and culture and broaden their idea of Estonians and Estonia by <br>reading
          and discussing literary texts. The course is taken in Form 12, when basic
          literary notions have been <br>acquired and the students’ command of Estonian
          allows them to read and understand more complex <br>literary texts. <br>

        of literature, students explore the history of expressions <br>known from
        myths, compare the worldview of ancient Estonians to that of other people,
        seek expressions <br>of myths and beliefs in fiction, comparatively explore

      label: 'Short description of the course <br> <br>The course teaches students
        to understand the basic principles of dramatic art and the important role
        of <br>theatre in culture. During the course, students read and analyse drama
        works, watch and interpret theatre <br>performances together and perform simpler
        staging assignments. The course provides theoretical <br>knowledge and teaches
        practical skills. Theatre history comprises only a small part of the scope
        of the <br>course but is nevertheless necessary in understanding modern theatrical
        art. Attention is primarily focused <br>on explaining the nature of drama,
        the specifics of theatre-making and analysing performances. If possible, <br>it
        is advisable to attend performances by professional theatres, but a performance
        by a school theatre is <br>also suitable for analysis. In order to get to
        know Estonian theatre classics, it is also possible to use <br>archival recordings.
        In its essence, theatre is the amalgamation of different forms of art by combining
        <br>music, dance, literature (video) film and the fine arts, and as such makes
        it possible to integrate the course <br>with music or art instruction. During

        and characters; <br>3) understand the main terms concerning drama writing
        and theatre; <br>4) can find connections between literature, theatre, the

        visions of the stage director, music director, set designer, <br>costume designer
        and acting; <br>6) deliberate over theatre performances, assess their values,
        analyse imagery and formulate their <br>experience as spectators; <br>7) write
        a review of a performance by applying the terms learned and interpreting theatrical
        signs <br>used in staging; <br>8) know the most important moments in Estonian

      label: 'Short description of the course <br> <br>The course focuses on the crossover
        points of literature and film. As cinematography is not taught <br>systematically
        in basic or upper secondary school, the course should give students a first
        overview of <br>modern filmmaking. The course focuses first and foremost on
        teaching the language of film (poetics), which <br>in turn forms an instrumental
        basis for teaching the subtheme ‘Film as an Interpretation of Literary Work’.
        <br> <br>In order to give students an overview of the nature of cinematography
        and teach them to understand the <br>uniform and distinctive poesy of film
        and literary work, teachers need sufficient visual aids (scenes of the <br>stages
        of filmmaking, fragments from films and literary works for close inspection)
        to plan their lessons, but <br>also up-to-date technology (video projectors,
        computers and other multimedia tools.). It is also advisable to <br>practise
        frame cutting and editing by using simpler film editing software in order
        to better understand the <br>nature of film imagery. The works to be examined
        in full (both films and literary works) are selected by the <br>teacher; the
        students are advised to read the specific literary work before watching the
        film. <br> <br>Learning and educational objectives  <br>The course ‘Literature
        and Film’ at the upper secondary school level are designed for students to:
        <br>1) acquire basic knowledge of the nature and reception of film and the
        impact on viewers; <br>2) perceive the poetry of film language in the interpretation
        of literary works. <br> <br>Learning outcomes <br>At the end of the course,
        students can: <br>1) describe in general terms the stages of filmmaking; <br>2)
        are familiar with the main poetic techniques in filmmaking; <br>3) understand
        the abstractness of film image and its role in carrying the meaning, also
        the director’s <br>attitude and message; <br>4) compare literary works to
        their film versions based on the poetics of film and literature; <br>5) deliberate
        on the aesthetics of films and literary works and the ethical values expressed
        in them <br>and formulate their experience as readers and spectators; <br>6)
        write a short script based on a fragment of a literary work and frame it;
        <br>7) write a review of a film by applying the knowledge acquired during
        the course and by assessing <br>the hidden or obvious values of the film and
        literary work; <br>8) are familiar with the main types of films and can characterise

      label: 'Short description of the course <br> <br>The course supports the approach
        to literary studies in upper secondary school i.e. acceptance of the <br>writer’s
        world of art in an historical and literary context in a very broad cultural
        setting consisting of Western <br>European literature. The course covers Antiquity,
        the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and the 18th century. <br>The course is based
        on literary history but is quite flexible in terms of chronological sequence.
        Problematic-<br>thematic approaches to studies of classics have also been
        taken into account in selecting the content of the <br>course. The course
        includes literary works which named the greatest masterpieces in world culture
        and <br>which have influenced the development of national literature. <br>49
        <br> <br> <br>The course develops students aesthetically, giving them the
        opportunity to explore sources of European <br>culture through artistic devices
        and experience timeless human moral values which are equally essential <br>today.
        It is assumed that students become acquainted with the most outstanding literary
        works of Antiquity, <br>the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, Classicism and the

        <br>concepts and moral ideals of the period most expressively. If the course
        is taken after the basic course, <br>special attention should be paid to the

      label: 'Short description of the course <br> <br>This course gives the students
        a good opportunity to understand the artistic world of writers in the global
        <br>historical and literary context. The course covers the period from the
        1980s to the present. The literary of <br>these years, particularly in the
        last decade, is too complicated for students to understand on their own, <br>because
        the process of cultural development has reached the stage of evolutionary
        crisis. There is no <br>51 <br> <br>common understanding in literary theory
        on how to qualify the concept of new literature. Therefore students <br>need
        the teacher’s help in acquiring new theoretical knowledge. <br> <br>In reviewing
        literary works, students rely on the theoretical and practical knowledge they
        have acquired and <br>on their life experience. The course covers contemporary
        literary works that are important for students in <br>terms of their problem
        disposition. The course helps students understand issues that are repeatedly
        raised <br>in contemporary Russian literature and form their opinion of them.
        Based on previous study of literary <br>classics and personal experience,
        students develop a continuing interest in reading and broaden their <br>horizons.
        <br> <br>Students become acquainted with outstanding works in modern Russian
        literature and analyse their artistic <br>peculiarities and the moral problems
        posed in them. It is important that students understand the aesthetic <br>specifics
        of works representing different literary trends, but they should also be able
        to interpret the <br>problems raised in these works through the prism of their
        own life experience. The list of literary works is <br>meant for guidance:
        teachers can decide themselves which works are to be examined in detail and
        which in <br>general. <br> <br>Learning and educational objectives <br>The
        course ‘Contemporary Russian Literature’ at the upper secondary school level
        are designed for <br>students to: <br>1) become familiar with the main tendencies
        in contemporary Russian literature and the creative <br>output and most outstanding
        works of modern Russian writers and learn to note traditions and <br>innovation
        in contemporary literature; <br>2) develop their skills of problem-based and
        literary theoretical analysis of literary works and <br>formulate their own
        attitudes to the works read; <br>3) develop their artistic tastes and learn
        to read knowledgeably and meaningfully, and <br>4) feel the need to read fiction
        and understand that literature is an inseparable part of an individual’s <br>intellectual
        culture. <br> <br>Learning outcomes <br>At the end of the course, students
        can: <br>1) name and analyse single works of Contemporary Russian literature;
        <br>2) can analyse and interpret content and form techniques of read poems
        and prose works: name the <br>theme, formulate the problem and lead idea,
        describe the time and location of events, the <br>narrator’s position, relations
        between characters, the setting, plot and composition; <br>3) understand and

      label: '21st Century’ <br> <br>Short description of the course <br> <br>The
        course introduces the students to the main tendencies in world literature
        from the 1960s to the present. <br>The literature of the period is extremely
        versatile in terms of its artistic trends and the problems raised. <br>Although
        its aim is not to examine all of the movements and trends in detail, the course
        still presumes that <br>the essential phenomena in world literature (neo-mythological
        novel, intellectual prose, novel-fable and <br>post-modern literature) need
        to be covered. In preparing the list of literary works, attention has been
        paid to <br>the artistic value of the work and the significance of the problems
        raised and the depth of their <br>interpretation, but the list also includes
        authors whose works have been characterised as forming part of <br>‘mass literature’.
        As mass fiction is an integral part of modern literature, it is necessary
        for students to be <br>familiar with it. The list of literary works is not
        exhaustive, since modern literature is constantly replenished <br>by new and
        interesting additions which can be added to the texts for reading and examination.
        The course <br>53 <br> <br>helps students find their way among these books,
        differentiate between recreational fiction and serious <br>works and see the
        difference between real literature and kitsch. <br> <br>Teachers select 4
        or 5 essential novels and stories from the list for integral analysis by taking
        into account <br>the interests of students and the significance of the problems
        raised in the works, and ensuring that the <br>texts are achievable for the
        students. The list of literature is not closed: teachers can add newly published
        <br>works by world authors to it provided that the translations are good.
        <br> <br>Learning and educational objectives <br>The course at the upper secondary
        school level are designed for students to: <br>1) gain familiarity with the
        main trends in foreign literature in the last five decades and with the <br>works
        of outstanding writers and understand world literature as part of the uniform
        process; <br>2) develop their skills of analysing works independently and
        integrally and form their attitudes <br>towards the works they have read;
        <br>3) refine their artistic tastes and learn to read purposefully and with
        understanding; and <br>4) feel the need to read fiction and understand that
        literature is an integral part of an individual’s <br>intellectual culture.
        <br> <br>Learning outcomes <br>At the end of the course, students can: <br>1)
        name and analyse single works of Contemporary World literature, understand
        these issues; <br>2) can analyse and interpret content and form techniques
        of read poems and prose works: name the <br>theme, formulate the problem and
        lead idea, describe the time and location of events, the <br>narrator’s position,
        relations between characters, the setting, plot and composition; <br>3) understand
        and appreciate humane, ethical and aesthetic values of literary works; <br>4)
        can express their reasoned opinions about the works they have read in spoken
        and written <br>formats and with accurate formatting; <br>5) can complete
        creative and research assignments and make presentations; <br>6) have read
        and analysed at least four longer prose works in full, are familiar with the
        position of <br>the works and their authors in the general history of culture
        and literature. <br> <br>Learning content <br>Themes. World literature in

        different types of study activities, but lectures are reduced to a minimum.
        <br>Different forms of independent work are of high priority: preparing presentations
        and written addresses, <br>reports, reviews and opinions and writing essays.
        <br>The goals set for the course can only be met through constant and systematic
        reading. Main attention is on <br>independent home reading, which is complemented
        by different types of reading during lessons. This is <br>absolutely essential
        for several reasons, including the possibility to hear the sound of the artistic
        word in <br>lessons of literature so that literary works are first and foremost
        perceived as works of art. Works are <br>discussed and analysed in the form
        of discussions, debates, readers’ conferences and seminars.'
